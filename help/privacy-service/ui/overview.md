# Privacy Service UI overview

Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service provides a RESTful API and user interface that allow you to coordinate privacy and compliance requests across various solutions. This document explores the Privacy Service UI. For information on using the API, please see the [Privacy Service developer guide](../api/getting-started.md).
