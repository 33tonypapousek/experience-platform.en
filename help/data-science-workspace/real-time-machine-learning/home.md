# Real-time Machine Learning overview

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Real-time Machine Learning is not available to all users yet. This feature is in alpha and still being tested. This document is subject to change.

Adobe Experience Platform's Real-time Machine Learning framework enables you to unleash the power of machine learning to deliver the right experiences to the right end-users at the right time and in the right channels in the sub-second time frame.

## Benefits

Real-time Machine Learning can dramatically enhance the relevance of your digital experience content to your end-users. This is made possible by leveraging real-time inferencing and continuous learning - all of which happens on the Experience Edge.

A combination of seamless computation on both the Hub and the Edge dramatically reduces the latency that is traditionally involved in powering hyper-personalized experiences that are both relevant and responsive. Hence, Real-time Machine Learning provides inferences with incredibly low latency for synchronous decision-making. Examples include rendering personalized web page content or surfacing of an offer or discount to reduce churn and increase conversions on a web store.

## Real-time Machine Learning architecture

The following diagram provides a high level view of the Real-time Machine Learning architecture.

## Real-time Machine Learning workflow (Alpha)

1. Data ingestion and preparations: data within AEP for model training .
2. Authoring: Create Real-Time Model
Authoring RT models.
Bring your own model (interoperable format)
3. Deployment: Deploy ML model to Edge with Prediction API Endpoint.
4. Inference: ML Inference on Edge.
5. Delivery: Delivery of experiences on a custom website/solutions.
