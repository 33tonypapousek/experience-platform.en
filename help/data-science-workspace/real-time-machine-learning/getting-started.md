# Getting started with real time machine learning

In order to utilize real time machine learning, you need to have access to an organization provisioned with Adobe Experience Platform and Data Science Workspace. Additionally, you need to have a dataset on Platform. 

## Datasets on Adobe Experience Platform

Datasets are used in real time machine learning. You have the option to use an external dataset and upload it to your JupyterLab environment or create a new dataset within Platform if you have not done so already.
