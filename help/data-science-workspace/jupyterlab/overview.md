# [!DNL JupyterLab] user guide

[!DNL JupyterLab] is a web-based user interface for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and is tightly integrated into Adobe Experience Platform. It provides an interactive development environment for data scientists to work with Jupyter notebooks, code, and data.

This document provides an overview of [!DNL JupyterLab] and its features as well as instructions to perform common actions.

## [!DNL JupyterLab] on [!DNL Experience Platform]

Experience Platform's JupyterLab integration is accompanied with architectural changes, design considerations, customized notebook extensions, pre-installed libraries, and an Adobe-themed interface.

The following list outlines some of the features that are unique to JupyterLab on Platform:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Kernels** | Kernels provide notebook and other [!DNL JupyterLab] front-ends the ability to execute and introspect code in different programming languages. [!DNL Experience Platform] provides additional kernels to support development in [!DNL Python], R, PySpark, and [!DNL Spark]. See the [kernels](#kernels) section for more details. |
| **Data access** | Access existing datasets directly from within [!DNL JupyterLab] with full support for read and write capabilities. |
| **[!DNL Platform] service integration** | Built-in integrations allows you to utilize other [!DNL Platform] services directly from within [!DNL JupyterLab]. A complete list of supported integrations is provided in the section on [Integration with other Platform services](#service-integration). |
| **Authentication** | In addition to <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html" target="_blank">JupyterLab's built-in security model</a>, every interaction between your application and Experience Platform, including Platform service-to-service communication is encrypted and authenticated through the <a href="https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html" target="_blank">[!DNL Adobe Identity Management System] (IMS)</a>. |
| **Development libraries** | In [!DNL Experience Platform], [!DNL JupyterLab] provides pre-installed libraries for [!DNL Python], R, and PySpark. See the [appendix](#supported-libraries) for a complete list of supported libraries. |
| **Library controller** | When the the pre-installed libraries are lacking for your needs, additional libraries can be installed for Python and R, and are temporarily stored in isolated containers to maintain the integrity of [!DNL Platform] and keep your data safe. See the [kernels](#kernels) section for more details. |

>[!NOTE]
>
>Additional libraries are only available for the session in which they were installed. You must reinstall any additional libraries you require when starting new sessions.

![](../images/jupyterlab/user-guide/main_work_area.gif)

### Code cells {#code-cells}

Code cells are the primary content of notebooks. They contain source code in the language of the notebook's associated kernel and the output as a result of executing the code cell. An execution count is displayed to the right of every code cell which represents its order of execution.

![](../images/jupyterlab/user-guide/code_cell.png)

Common cell actions are described below:

*   **Add a cell:** Click the plus symbol (**+**) from the notebook menu to add an empty cell. New cells are placed under the cell that is currently being interacted with, or at the end of the notebook if no particular cell is in focus.

*   **Move a cell:** Place your cursor to the right of the cell you wish to move, then click and drag the cell to a new location. Additionally, moving a cell from one notebook to another replicates the cell along with its contents.

*   **Execute a cell:** Click on the body of the cell you wish to execute and then click the **play** icon (**â–¶**) from the notebook menu. An asterisk (**\***) is displayed in the cell's execution counter when the kernel is processing the execution, and is replaced with an integer upon completion.

*   **Delete a cell:** Click on the body of the cell you wish to delete and then click the **scissor** icon.

### Kernels {#kernels}

Notebook kernels are the language-specific computing engines for processing notebook cells. In addition to [!DNL Python], [!DNL JupyterLab] provides additional language support in R, PySpark, and [!DNL Spark] (Scala). When you open a notebook document, the associated kernel is launched. When a notebook cell is executed, the kernel performs the computation and produces results which may consume significant CPU and memory resources. Note that allocated memory is not freed until the kernel is shut-down.

Certain features and functionalities are limited to particular kernels as described in the table below:

| Kernel | Library installation support | [!DNL Platform] integrations |
| :----: | :--------------------------: | :-------------------- |
| **[!DNL Python]** | Yes | <ul><li>[!DNL Sensei ML Framework]</li><li>[!DNL Catalog Service]</li><li>[!DNL Query Service]</li></ul> |
| **R** | Yes | <ul><li>[!DNL Sensei ML Framework]</li><li>[!DNL Catalog Service]</li></ul> |
| **Scala** | No | <ul><li>[!DNL Sensei ML Framework]</li><li>[!DNL Catalog Service]</li></ul> |

### Kernel sessions {#kernel-sessions}

Each active notebook or activity on [!DNL JupyterLab] utilizes a kernel session. All active sessions can be found by expanding the **Running terminals and kernels** tab from the left sidebar. The type and state of the kernel for a notebook can be identified by observing the top right of the notebook interface. In the diagram below, the notebook's associated kernel is **[!DNL Python] 3** and the its current state is represented by a grey circle to the right. A hollow circle implies an idling kernel and a solid circle implies a busy kernel.

![](../images/jupyterlab/user-guide/kernel_and_state_1.png)

If the kernel is shut-down or inactive for a prolonged period, then **No Kernel!** with a solid circle is shown. Activate a kernel by clicking the kernel status and selecting the appropriate kernel type as demonstrated below:

![](../images/jupyterlab/user-guide/switch_kernel.gif)

### GPU and memory server configuration in [!DNL Python]/R

In [!DNL JupyterLab] select the gear icon in the top-right corner to open *Notebook server configuration*. You can toggle GPU on and allocate the amount of memory you need by using the slider. The amount of memory you can allocate depends on how much your organization has provisioned. Select **[!UICONTROL Update configs]** to save.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only one GPU is provisioned per organization for Notebooks. If the GPU is in use, you need to wait for the user that has currently reserved the GPU to release it. This can be done by logging out or leaving the GPU in an idle state for four or more hours.
