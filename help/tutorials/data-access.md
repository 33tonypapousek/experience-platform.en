# Data Access tutorials

Data Access supports Adobe Experience Platform by providing users tools focused on the discoverability and accessibility of ingested datasets within Experience Platform.

To learn more, begin by reading the [Data Access overview](../data-access/home.md).

## Query a dataset data using the Data Access API

The Data Access API supports Adobe Experience Platform by providing users with a RESTful interface focused on the discoverability and accessibility of ingested datasets within Experience Platform.

**This tutorial will help you:**
- Locate data within Platform.
- Access a file using a file ID.
- Retrieve the metadata of a file.
- Access the contents of a file.
- Download partial contents of a file.
- Configure API response pagination.

To get started, follow the [Data Access API tutorial](../data-access/tutorials/dataset-data.md).

## Use the Secure Python SDK to access data

The Secure Python Data Access SDK is a software development kit that enables reading and writing of datasets from Experience Platform using Python.

**This guide will help you:**
- Set up your environment and install the correct packages.
- Read from a dataset.
- Write to a dataset.
- Read and write to a userspace directory.

To get started, view the [Python Data Access SDK documentation](../data-access/tutorials/python-sdk.md).

## Use the Secure Spark SDK to access data

The Secure Spark Data Access SDK is a software development kit that enables reading and writing of datasets from Adobe Experience Platform using Spark.

**This guide will help you:**
- Set up your environment and install the correct packages.
- Read from a dataset.
- Write to a dataset.

To get started, view the [Spark Data Access SDK documentation](../data-access/tutorials/spark-sdk.md).
