# Adobe Experience Platform Observability Insights overview

Observability Insights is a RESTful API that allows you to expose key observability metrics in Adobe Experience Platform. These metrics provide insights into [!DNL Platform] usage statistics, health-checks for [!DNL Platform] services, historical trends, and performance indicators for various [!DNL Platform] functionalities. 

This document demonstrates an example call to the Observability Insights API. For a complete list of Observability endpoints, please refer to the [Observability Insights API reference](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/observability-insights.yaml).

## Getting started

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](../tutorials/authentication.md). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

* `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
* `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`
* `x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform] are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in. For more information on sandboxes in [!DNL Platform], see the [sandbox overview documentation](../sandboxes/home.md).

* `x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}`

## Retrieve observability metrics

You can retrieve observability metrics by making a request to the `/metrics` endpoint in the Observability Insights API. There are two supported methods for retrieving metric data:

* [Version 1](#v1): Specify metrics using query parameters.
* [Version 2](#v2): Specify and apply filters to metrics using a JSON payload.

### Version 1 {#v1}

You can retrieve metrics data by making a GET request to the `/metrics` endpoint, specifying metrics through the use of query parameters.

**API format**

At least one metric must be provided in the `metric` parameter. Other query parameters are optional for filtering results.

```http
GET /metrics?metric={METRIC}
GET /metrics?metric={METRIC}&metric={METRIC_2}
GET /metrics?metric={METRIC}&id={ID}
GET /metrics?metric={METRIC}&dateRange={DATE_RANGE}
GET /metrics?metric={METRIC}&metric={METRIC_2}&id={ID}&dateRange={DATE_RANGE}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{METRIC}` | The metric you want to expose. When combining multiple metrics in a single call, you must use an ampersand (`&`) to separate individual metrics. For example, `metric={METRIC_1}&metric={METRIC_2}`. |
| `{ID}` | The identifier for a particular [!DNL Platform] resource whose metrics you want to expose. This ID may be optional, required, or not applicable depending on the metrics being used. For a list of available metrics, as well as supported IDs (both required and optional) for each metric, see the reference document on [available metrics](metrics.md). |
| `{DATE_RANGE}` | The date range for the metrics you want to expose, in ISO 8601 format (for example, `2018-10-01T07:00:00.000Z/2018-10-09T07:00:00.000Z`). |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/infrastructure/observability/insights/metrics?metric=timeseries.ingestion.dataset.size&metric=timeseries.ingestion.dataset.recordsuccess.count&id=5cf8ab4ec48aba145214abeb&dateRange=2018-10-01T07:00:00.000Z/2019-06-06T07:00:00.000Z \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns a list of objects, each containing a timestamp within the provided `dateRange` and corresponding values for the metrics specified in the request path. If the `id` of a [!DNL Platform] resource is included in the request path, the results will apply only to that particular resource. If the `id` is omitted, the results will apply to all applicable resources within your IMS Organization.

        }
      }
    ],
    "_page": null,
    "_links": null
  },
  "stats": {}
}
```

### Version 2 {#v2}

You can retrieve metrics data by making a POST request to the `/metrics` endpoint, specifying the metrics you wish to retrieve in the payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /metrics
```

**Request**

```sh
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/infrastructure/observability/insights/metrics \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \

          },
          {
            "name": "timeseries.ingestion.dataset.dailysize",
            "filters": [
              {
                "name": "dataSetId",
                "value": "5eddb21420f516191b7a8dad",
                "groupBy": false
              }

```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `start` | The earliest date/time from which to retrieve metric data. |
| `end` | The latest date/time from which to retrieve metric data. |
| `granularity` | An optional field that indicates the a time interval to divide metric data by. For example, a value of `DAY` returns metrics for each day between the `start` and `end` date, whereas a value of `MONTH` would group metric results by month instead. When using this field, a corresponding `downsample` property must also be provided to indicate the aggregation function by which to group data. |
| `metrics` | An array of objects, one for each metric you want to retrieve. |
| `name` | The name of a metric recognized by Observability Insights. See the [metrics reference](./metrics.md) for a full list of accepted metric names. |
| `filters` | An optional field that allows you to filter metrics by specific datasets. The field is an array of objects (one for each filter), with each object containing the following properties: <ul><li>`name`: The type of entity to filter metrics against. Currently, only `dataSets` is supported.</li><li>`value`: The ID of one or more datasets. Multiple dataset IDs can be provided as a single string, with each ID separated by vertical bar characters (`|`).</li><li>`groupBy`: When set to true, indicates that the corresponding `value` represents multiple datasets whose metric results should be returned separately. If set to false, metric results for those datasets are grouped together.
| `aggregator` | An optional field that allows you to specify an aggregation function to group multiple times-series records into a single result. For detailed information on available aggregators, refer to the [OpenTSDB documentation](http://opentsdb.net/docs/build/html/user_guide/query/aggregators.html). |
| `downsample` | An optional field that allows you to specify an aggregation function to reduce the sampling rate of metric data by sorting fields into intervals (or "buckets"). The interval for the downsampling is termined by the `granularity` property. For detailed information on downsampling, refer to the [OpenTSDB documentation](http://opentsdb.net/docs/build/html/user_guide/query/downsampling.html). |

**Response**

A successful response returns the resulting datapoints for the metrics and filters specified in the request.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `metricResponses` | An array whose objects represent each of the metrics specified in the request. Each object contains information about the filter configuration and returned metric data. |
| `metric` | The name of one of the metrics provided in the request. |
| `filters` | The filter configuration for the specified metric. |
| `datapoints` | An array whose objects represent the results of the specified metric and filters. The number of objects in the array depends on the filter options provided in the request. If no filters were provided, the array will only contain a single object that represents all datasets. |
| `groupBy` | If multiple datasets were specified in the `filter` property for a metric, and the `groupBy` option was set to true in the request, this object will contain the ID of the dataset that the corresponding `dps` property applies to.<br><br>If this object appears empty in the response, the corresponding `dps` property applies to all datasets provided in the `filters` array (or all datasets in [!DNL Platform] if no filters were provided). |
| `dps` | The returned data for the given metric, filter, and time range. Each key in this object represents a timestamp with a corresponding value for the specified metric. The time period between each datapoint depends on the `granularity` value specified in the request. |
