# Widget library overview {#widget-library}

Within the Adobe Experience Platform user interface, you can view and interact with your organization's data using multiple dashboards. You can also update some of these dashboards by adding new widgets to your dashboard view. In addition to the standard widgets provided by Adobe, you can create custom widgets and share them throughout your organization. 

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for adding standard widgets and creating custom widgets to customize the information that is displayed within the [!UICONTROL Profiles], [!UICONTROL Segments], and [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboards in the Platform UI.

For information on how to modify the location and size of widgets in the [!UICONTROL Profiles], [!UICONTROL Destinations], and [!UICONTROL Segments] dashboards, please refer to the [modify dashboards guide](modify.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The widgets shown in the [!UICONTROL License usage] dashboard cannot be customized. To learn more about this unique dashboard, read the [license usage dashboard documentation](guides/license-usage.md).

## Access the widget library

From any dashboard (for example, the Profiles dashboard), you can select **[!UICONTROL Modify dashboard]** followed by **[!UICONTROL Widget library]** in order to access the widget library.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!UICONTROL Widget library] button only appears once [!UICONTROL Modify dashboard] has been selected.

## View the widget library

The [!UICONTROL Widget library] contains two tabs, [!UICONTROL Standard] and [!UICONTROL Custom].

* The **[!UICONTROL Standard]** tab contains widgets created by Adobe and allows you to update your dashboard using these standard metrics. To learn more about adding standard widgets to your dashboard, refer to the guide for [using standard widgets in dashboards](standard-widgets.md).
* The **[!UICONTROL Custom]** tab allows you to create and share widgets within your organization. For complete steps to creating your own widgets, please refer to the [custom widgets for dashboards guide](custom-widgets.md).
