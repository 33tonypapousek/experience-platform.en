Adobe Experience Platform provides multiple dashboards through which you can view important information about your organization's data, as captured during daily snapshots.

## Understanding dashboards

The attribute data in the snapshot shows the data exactly as it appears at the specific point in time when the snapshot was taken. In other words, the snapshot is not an approximation or sample of the data, and the Profile dashboard is not updating in real time.

>[!NOTE]

>Any changes or updates made to the data since the snapshot was taken will not be reflected in the dashboard until the next snapshot is taken.

Segment dashboards offer you an opportunity to deeply study subsegments within a segment and leverage that insight for better targeting. 
Destinations dashboard gives you insight into the operational specifics of activation and the associated segments.
