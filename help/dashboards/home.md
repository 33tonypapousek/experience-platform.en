Adobe Experience Platform provides multiple dashboards through which you can view important information about your organization's data, as captured during daily snapshots.

## Understanding dashboards

Dashboards provide out-of-the-box reporting on your organization's data and are built directly into the marketer workflow within Platform. These dashboards are available without the need for additional IT support or the time and effort it would otherwise take to export and process data with additional data warehousing design and implementation.

## Getting started with dashboards

The attribute data in the snapshot shows the data exactly as it appears at the specific point in time when the snapshot was taken. In other words, the snapshot is not an approximation or sample of the data, and the dashboards are not updating in real time.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Any changes or updates made to the data since the snapshot was taken will not be reflected in the dashboard until the next snapshot is taken.

To access dashboards, navigate to the appropriate section within the Platform user interface (UI), depending on the data you would like to view. For more information on available dashboards and descriptions of the widgets contained therein, please see the individual dashboard guides linked from the [available dashboards](#available-dashboards) section that follows.

## Available dashboards

There are currently four dashboards available, each providing transparency into the customer experience management function
Profile dashboards give you an understanding of profile composition and health by attributes such as channel, geolocation, and other attributes specific to your business.
Segment dashboards offer you an opportunity to deeply study subsegments within a segment and leverage that insight for better targeting. 
Destinations dashboard gives you insight into the operational specifics of activation and the associated segments
