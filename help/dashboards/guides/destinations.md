# (Beta) [!UICONTROL Desinations] dashboard

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The dashboard functionality outlined in this document is currently in beta and is not available to all users. The documentation and the functionality are subject to change.

The Adobe Experience Platform user interface (UI) provides a dashboard through which you can view important information about your destination data, as captured during a daily snapshot. This guide outlines how to access and work with the destinations dashboard in the UI and provides more information regarding the metrics displayed in the dashboard.  

For an overview of destinations, as well as a catalog of all available destinations within Experience Platform, please visit the [destinations overview](../../destinations/home.md).

## [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard data {#destinations-dashboard-data}

Coming soon

<!-- The [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard displays a snapshot of the attribute (record) data that your organization has within the Profile store in Experience Platform. The snapshot does not include any event (time series) data. 

The attribute data in the snapshot shows the data exactly as it appears at the specific point in time when the snapshot was taken. In other words, the snapshot is not an approximation or sample of the data, and the Profile dashboard is not updating in real time.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Any changes or updates made to the data since the snapshot was taken will not be reflected in the dashboard until the next snapshot is taken.

The metrics displayed in the [!UICONTROL Profiles] dashboard are based on the default merge policy for your organization. For more information on merge policies, and how to select or change your default merge policy, please visit the [merge policies UI guide](../../profile/ui/merge-policies.md). -->

## Exploring the destinations dashboard

To navigate to the destinations dashboard within the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** in the left rail, then select the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** tab to display the dashboard.

### Widgets and metrics

The dashboard is composed of widgets, which are read-only metrics providing important information regarding your destinations data. The "last updated" date and time on the widget show when the last snapshot of the data was taken.
