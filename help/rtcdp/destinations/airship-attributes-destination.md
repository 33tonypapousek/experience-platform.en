# (Beta) [!DNL Airship Attributes] Destination {#airship-attributes-destination}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The [!DNL Airship Attributes] destination in Adobe Experience Platform is currently in beta. The documentation and the functionality are subject to change.

## Overview {#overview}

[!DNL Airship] is the leading Customer Engagement Platform, helping you deliver meaningful, personalized omnichannel messaging to your users at every stage of the customer lifecycle.

This integration passes Adobe profile data into [!DNL Airship] as [Attributes](https://docs.airship.com/guides/audience/attributes/) for targeting or triggering.

To learn more about [!DNL Airship], see the [Airship Docs](https://docs.airship.com).


>[!TIP]
>
>This documentation page was created by the [!DNL Airship] team. For any inquiries or update requests, please contact them directly at [support.airship.com](https://support.airship.com/).

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you can send your audience segments to [!DNL Airship], you must:

* Enable attributes in your [!DNL Airship] project.
* Generate a bearer token for authentication.

>[!TIP]
>
>Create an [!DNL Airship] account via [this signup link](https://go.airship.eu/accounts/register/plan/starter/) if you have not already.

### Enable attributes {#enable-attributes}

Adobe Experience Platform profile attributes are similar to [!DNL Airship] attributes and can be easily mapped to one another in Platform using the mapping tool demonstrated further below on this page.

[!DNL Airship] projects have several predefined and default attributes. If you have a custom attribute, you must define it in [!DNL Airship] first. See [Set Up and Manage Attributes](https://docs.airship.com/tutorials/audience/attributes/) for details.

### Bearer token {#bearer-token}

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Settings]** Â» **[!UICONTROL APIs & Integrations]** in the [Airship dashboard](https://go.airship.com) and select **[!UICONTROL Tokens]** in the left-hand menu.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create Token]**.
1. Provide a user-friendly name for your token, e.g., "Adobe Attributes Destination", and select "All Access" for the role.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create Token]** and save the details as confidential.


## Use Cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL Airship Attributes] destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Use Case #1

Leverage profile data collected within Adobe Experience Platform for personalization of the message and rich content within any of [!DNL Airship]'s channels. For example, leverage [!DNL Experience Platform] profile data to set location attributes within [!DNL Airship]. This will enable a hotel brand to display an image for the nearest hotel location for each user.

### Use Case #2

Leverage Attributes from Adobe Experience Platform to further enrich [!DNL Airship] profiles and combine it with SDK or [!DNL Airship] predictive data. For example, a retailer can create a segment with loyalty status and location data (attributes from Platform) and [!DNL Airship] predicted to churn data to send highly targeted messages to users in the gold loyalty status who live in Las Vegas, NV, and have a high probability of churning.

## Connect to [!DNL Airship] Attributes {#connect-airship-attributes}

1. In **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]**, scroll to the **[!UICONTROL Mobile Engagement]** category. Select **[!DNL Airship Attributes]**, then select **[!UICONTROL Configure]**.

## Activate segments {#activate-segments}

To activate segments to [!DNL Airship Attributes], follow the steps below:

1. In **[!UICONTROL Destinations > Browse]**, select the [!DNL Airship Attributes] destination where you want to activate your segments.
    ![activate-flow](/help/rtcdp/destinations/assets/airship-attributes-activate1.png)
1. Click the name of the destination. This takes you to the Activate flow.
    Note that if an activation flow already exists for a destination, you can see the segments that are currently being sent to the destination. Select **[!UICONTROL Edit activation]** in the right rail and follow the steps below to modify the activation details. ![activate-flow](/help/rtcdp/destinations/assets/airship-attributes-activate2.png)
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Activate]**;
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Activate destination]** workflow, on the **[!UICONTROL Select Segments]** page, select which segments to send to [!DNL Airship Attributes].
    ![segments-to-destination](/help/rtcdp/destinations/assets/airship3-select-segments-to-export.png)
1.  In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select which attributes and identities from the [XDM](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-platform/xdm/home.html) schema to map to the destination schema. Select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]** to browse your schema and map them to the corresponding target identity.
    ![identity mapping initial screen](/help/rtcdp/destinations/assets/gcm-identity-mapping.png)
    [!DNL Airship] attributes can be set either on a channel, which represents device instance, e.g., iPhone, or a named user, which maps all of a user's devices to a common identifier such as a customer ID. If you have plain text (unhashed) email addresses as primary identity in your schema, select the email field in your **[!UICONTROL Source Attributes]** and map to the [!DNL Airship] named user in the right column under **[!UICONTROL Target Identities]**, as shown below.
    ![Named User Mapping](/help/rtcdp/destinations/assets/airshiptags7-mappingoption2.png)
    For identifiers that should be mapped to a channel, i.e., a device, map to the appropriate channel based on the source. The following images show how two mappings are created:

    * IDFA iOS Advertising ID to an [!DNL Airship] iOS channel
    * Adobe `fullName` attribute to [!DNL Airship] "Full Name" attribute

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Use the user-friendly name that appears in the [!DNL Airship] dashboard when selecting the target field for your attribute mapping.
