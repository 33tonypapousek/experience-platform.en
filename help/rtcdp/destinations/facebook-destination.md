# Facebook Destination 

## Overview

Activate profiles for your Facebook campaigns for audience targeting, personalization and suppression based on hashed emails.

## Destination specs

### Activation Type

Segment Export - you are exporting all members of a segment (audience) with their identifiers (name, phone number, etc.) used in the Facebook destination

1. Your [!DNL Facebook] user account must have the **Manage campaigns** permission enabled for the Ad account that you plan to use.
2. Add the **Adobe Experience Cloud** business account as an advertising partner in your [!DNL Facebook Ad Account]. Use `business ID=206617933627973`. See [Add Partners to Your Business Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1717412048538897) for details.
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > When configuring the permissions for Adobe Experience Cloud, you must enable the **Manage campaigns** permission. This is required for the [!DNL People-Based Destinations] integration.
3. Read and sign the [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] Terms of Service. To do this, go to `https://business.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos/?act=[accountID]`, where `accountID` is your [!DNL Facebook Ad Account ID].
