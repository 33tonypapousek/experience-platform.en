# Destinations Overview

![Destinations overview banner](/help/rtcdp/destinations/assets/destinations-overview-banner.png)

**Destinations** are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Real-time Customer Data Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

## Destinations and Sources

One of the core functionalities of Real-time CDP is ingesting your first-party data and activating it for your business needs. Use sources to ingest data into Real-time CDP and destinations to export data from Real-time CDP. 

## Destinations steps

* Choose from a [self-service catalog](/help/rtcdp/destinations/destinations-catalog.md) of all the destinations available in Real-time CDP.
* Use **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** to [activate](/help/rtcdp/destinations/activate-destinations.md) and send profiles or segments to marketing automation platforms, digital advertising platforms, and more.
* Schedule data exports to your preferred destinations at regular times.

## Controls

The controls in the [Destinations workspace](/help/rtcdp/destinations/destinations-workspace.md) allow you to:

* Browse the catalog of destination platforms where you can activate your data;
* Create, edit, activate, and disable data flows to the destinations in the catalog;
* Create an account in a storage location or link Real-time CDP to the account in the destination platform;
* Select which segments should be activated to destinations;
* Select which [Experience Data Model (XDM) fields](../../xdm/home.md) to export when activating segments to email marketing destinations.

## Destination types and categories 

For detailed information, see the [destination types and categories overview](/help/rtcdp/destinations/destination-types.md).

## Destinations and Access Controls

The destinations functionality in Real-time CDP works with Adobe Experience Platform access control permissions. Depending on your user's permission level, you can view, manage, and activate destinations. For information about the individual permissions, see [Access control in Adobe Experience Platform](../../access-control/home.md) and scroll down to the bottom of the page.

For more information about access controls, see the [Access control user guide](../../access-control/ui/overview.md).

## Destinations and Data Usage Labeling and Enforcement (DULE)

Data Usage Labeling and Enforcement (DULE) is the core mechanism of Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance. DULE is currently *not* enforced in Adobe Real-time CDP destinations.

You are responsible for understanding the limitations and obligations of your data and how you use that data in Experience Platform.
