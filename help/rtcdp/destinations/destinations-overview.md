# Destinations Overview

Use **Destinations** in the Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform to activate your known and unknown data for downstream marketing campaigns, email campaigns, site personalization, and many other use cases.

## Destinations and Sources

One of the core functionalities of Real-time CDP is ingesting data from your owned properties and activating your data for your business needs. Use **[!UICONTROL Sources]** to ingest data into Real-time CDP and **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** to export data from Real-time CDP. 

## Destinations steps

* Use **Destinations** to [activate](/help/rtcdp/destinations/activate-destinations.md) and send profiles or segments to marketing automation platforms, digital advertising platforms, and more.
* Choose from a [self-service catalog](/help/rtcdp/destinations/destinations-catalog.md) of all the destinations available in Real-time CDP.
* Schedule data exports to your preferred destinations at regular times.

## Controls

The controls in the [Destinations workspace](/help/rtcdp/destinations/destinations-workspace.md) allow you to:

* Browse the catalog of digital properties where you can activate your data;
* Create, edit, activate, and disable data flows to the destinations in the catalog;
* Select which segments should be activated to destinations;
* Select which [XDM data fields](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/xdm/xdmservices.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/technical_overview/schema_registry/xdm_system/xdm_system_in_experience_platform.md) to export when activating segments to email marketing destinations.

## Types of destinations

You can activate data to several types of destinations in the Real-time Customer Data Platform. For a list of destination types and information on each of them, see the [Destination catalog](/help/rtcdp/destinations/destinations-catalog.md).
