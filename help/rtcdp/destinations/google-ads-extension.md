# Google Ads Destination

## Overview

The Google Ads extension is an advertising destination in Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform. For more information about the extension functionality, see the extension page on [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/experiencecloud.details.101383.google-ads.html).

## Install extension

To install the Google Ads extension:

1. In Adobe Real-time CDP, go to **Destinations > Catalog**.
2. Browse to the extension in the destinations interface or use the search bar to find it.
3. Select the destination, select **Install Extension** in the right rail. If the **Install Extension** control is greyed out, contact your organization administrator and ask them to grant you the **manage_properties** permission in Experience Platform Launch.
4. In the modal window, select the Experience Platform Launch property in which you want to install the extension. You also have the option of creating a new property in Experience Platform Launch if you haven't created one yet.
5. The workflow takes you to Experience Platform Launch to complete the installation.


## How to use the extension

Once you installed the extension, you can start setting up rules for it directly in Experience Platform Launch.

In Experience Platform Launch, you can set up rules for your installed extensions to send event data to the extension destination only in certain situations. For more information about setting up rules for your extensions, see [Rules documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/launch/using/reference/manage-resources/rules.html).

## Configure and delete extension

Even if an extension is installed on one of your properties, the Adobe Real-time CDP UI still displays **[!UICONTROL Install]** for the extension. Kick off the installation workflow as described in Install extension to get to Launch and configure or delete your extension.
