# Adobe Launch destinations {#adobe-launch-destinations}

Adobe Launch is the next-generation of tag management capabilities from Adobe. Launch gives customers a simple way to deploy and manage all of the analytics, marketing, and advertising tags necessary to power relevant customer experiences. Read more in the [Adobe Launch documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/launch/using/overview.html).

## How Launch extensions work

Launch extensions forward event data to several types of destinations. **Event Forwarding** is a simpler type of integration with destination platforms, which only forwards raw event data. **Profile/Segment Export** destinations in Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform capture event data, combine it with other data sources, apply segmentation, and export segments and qualified profiles to destinations.

## Benefits of using Adobe Launch extensions

Adobe Launch is free for existing Experience Cloud customers. Adobe Launch simplifies tag deployment on your website via easy-to-use extensions that you can install, configure, update, and delete. Adobe Launch has a small footprint on your website and allows you to keep your pages loading quickly.

You can create *rules* that determine when to forward event data to extensions. This  powerful functionality enables you to forward event data only in certain situations as opposed to sending event data on every interaction. For more information, read about rules in the [Adobe Launch documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/launch/using/reference/manage-resources/rules.html).

## Example use cases for Adobe Launch extensions

Launch extensions enable you to satisfy various customer use cases. Some example use cases for using Launch extensions are:

* You can send website or native app data to Facebook via the Facebook pixel extension. Facebook Pixel indicates which parts of your site or app a visitor navigated to, forwards that information to Facebook, and you can retarget your visitor via Facebook.
* You can forward event data from your websites and apps into Google Analytics to analyze and make decisions based on that data.
* You could turn on a client-side chatbox app at the right time based on how your users are interacting with your pages, according to rules you set up in Adobe Launch.


## Extension categories

Launch extensions can be grouped into the following categories:

* Advertising
* Analytics
* CRM
* Data Management Platform
* Email
* Personalization
* Surveys
* Voice of the customer

You can find documentation for each extension on https://exchange.adobe.com/.
