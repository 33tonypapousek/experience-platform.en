# Adobe Campaign Classic

Adobe Campaign lets you coordinate the creation of conversational marketing campaigns. Adobe Campaign has innovative features to model, streamline, and automate marketing and customer communication processes. See [About Adobe Campaign Classic](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/starting-with-adobe-campaign/about-adobe-campaign-classic.html) for more information.

## Set up destination

Because Adobe Campaign Classic is an email marketing destination, you must follow the connect flow described in [Email marketing destinations](/help/rtcdp/destinations/email-marketing-destinations.md). For account details, see the sections below.

## Destination attributes

After connecting Real-time CDP to your Amazon S3 or SFTP storage, you must set up the data import from your storage location into Adobe Campaign. To learn how to accomplish this, see [Importing Subscribers into Marketing Cloud from a File](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=mc_es_import_subscribers_from_file.htm&type=5) in the Salesforce Help Center.
