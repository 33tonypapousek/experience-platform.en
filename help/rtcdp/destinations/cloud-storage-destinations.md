# Cloud storage destinations {#cloud-storage-destinations}

In Adobe Real-time CDP, you can export your data to your own storage locations. This enables you to send profile attributes to your internal systems, via CSV or tab-delimited files.

Real-time CDP currently supports two cloud storage destinations -  Amazon S3 and SFTP. We will be adding more cloud storage destinations in subsequent releases.

Currently, available cloud storage destinations are:

* [Amazon S3](/help/rtcdp/destinations/amazon-s3-destination.md)
* [SFTP](/help/rtcdp/destinations/sftp-destination.md)
