# Cloud storage destinations {#cloud-storage-destinations}

Adobe Real-time CDP can deliver your segments as data files to your Amazon S3 or SFTP cloud storage locations. This enables you to send audiences and their profile attributes to your internal systems, via CSV or tab-delimited files.

Adobe Real-time CDP currently supports two cloud storage destinations -  [Amazon S3](/help/rtcdp/destinations/amazon-s3-destination.md) and [SFTP](/help/rtcdp/destinations/sftp-destination.md). We will be adding more cloud storage destinations in subsequent releases.
