# Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform overview

Built on Adobe Experience Platform, Real-Time Customer Data Platform (Real-time CDP) helps companies bring together known and unknown data to activate customer profiles with intelligent decisioning throughout the customer journey. Real-time CDP compiles individual profiles from sensitive existing customer data to create a unified and persistent profile that can be used to provide one-to-one personalized customer experiences across all known channels and devices.
 
Real-Time Customer Data Platform includes tools for data governance, identity management, advanced segmentation, and data science so you can transform raw data into valuable profiles and audiences. 
 
Adobe connects to a large ecosystem of partners, not to mention native integrations with Adobe Experience Cloud, so you can seamlessly activate these audiences and deliver great customer experiences across all channels, from on-site or in-app personalization to email, paid media, call centers, connected devices, and more.

With Real-time CDP, you can:

* Achieve a single view of your customer with streaming collection of customer data from across the enterprise.
* Responsibly manage profiles with trusted governance and privacy controls for known and unknown identifiers.
* Generate actionable insights and scale audiences with AI and machine learning powered by Adobe Sensei and built for marketers.
* Deliver personalized experiences in real-time across all channels and destinations, from cookie- and device-based to people-based environments.

## Use Case

A real-time CDP can provide continuous data refreshes that keep customer profiles updated. For IT, having all customer information in a unified view means you can resolve customer identity issues so any system can access a consistent customer profile in real time. Call-center teams, for example, have access to richer customer profiles, such as what a customer was looking at online before calling. As a result, customer service representatives deliver a better experience for the customer.

At the same time, marketing teams gain insights into the actions customers have taken online or offline. This gives marketers the ability to run timely, relevant retargeting campaigns or display a compelling offer in real time based on that data.

These use cases help retain customers, advance existing customers, and build higher loyalty.

With the Adobe real-time CDP, you can:

1. Collect data from disparate platforms and make sure itâ€™s available downstream for other marketing activities. 

1. Create a single, real-time view of your consumers, independent of where data originates.  

1. Drive a consistent, relevant, and personalized experience across every touchpoint.
