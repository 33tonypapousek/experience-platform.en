# Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform overview

Built on Adobe Experience Platform, Real-Time Customer Data Platform (Real-time CDP) helps companies bring together known and unknown data to activate customer profiles with intelligent decisioning throughout the customer journey. Real-time CDP compiles individual profiles from sensitive existing customer data to create a unified and persistent profile that can be used to provide one-to-one personalized customer experiences across all known channels and devices. 

Real-Time Customer Data Platform includes tools for data governance, identity management, advanced segmentation, and data science so you can transform raw data into valuable profiles and audiences. 

Adobe connects to a large ecosystem of partners, not to mention native integrations with Adobe Experience Cloud, so you can seamlessly activate these audiences and deliver great customer experiences across all channels, from on-site or in-app personalization to email, paid media, call centers, connected devices, and more.

With Real-time CDP, you can:

* Achieve a single view of your customer with streaming collection of customer data from across the enterprise.
* Responsibly manage profiles with trusted governance and privacy controls for known and unknown identifiers.
* Generate actionable insights and scale audiences with AI and machine learning powered by Adobe Sensei and built for marketers.
* Deliver personalized experiences in real-time across all channels and destinations.
