# Segment Builder guide

Built on top of Adobe Experience Platform, Real-time Customer Data Platform is able to make use of the full Segment Builder capabilities that are a part of Experience Platform.

Within the Segment Builder's user interface, you can create new segments, access existing segments, and modify existing segments.

 For a more detailed guide on the Segment Builder, please read the [Segment Builder user guide on Adobe I/O](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/profile-identity-segmentation/profile-identity-segmentation-services.html#!end-user/markdown/segmentation_overview/segment-builder-guide.md).
