# Viewing profiles in Real-time CDP

Real-time Customer Profile creates a holistic view of each of your individual customers, combining data from multiple channels including online, offline, CRM, and third-party data. As individual profiles are aggregated based on data being brought into the system from various sources, each profile becomes an actionable, timestamped account of every interaction your customer has with your brand.

Within the user interface, you can view these read-only profiles and see important information regarding the individual customer such as preferences, past events and interactions, and segments to which the individual belongs.

Since Real-time Customer Data Platform is built on top of Adobe Experience Platform, Real-time CDP is able to make use of the profile viewing capabilities that are part of Experience Platform. For a detailed guide to viewing customer profiles within the Platform user interface, please see the [Real-time Customer Profile user guide on Adobe I/O](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/profile-identity-segmentation/profile-identity-segmentation-services.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/technical_overview/unified_profile_architectural_overview/profile-user-guide.md).
