# A unified view of your customer in Real-time CDP

Real-time Customer Data Platform (Real-time CDP) enables you to drive coordinated and consistent experiences for your customers no matter where or when they interact with your brand. Delivering these personalized experiences so that they feel relevant and timely is no small feat, but it can be achieved through the use of Real-time Customer Profile, part of Adobe Experience Platform.

Real-time CDP is built on top of Adobe Experience Platform and utilizes many of the Experience Platform services and functionality, including the creation of Real-time Customer Profiles, aggregated from customer data across your many marketing channels and systems storing data for your organization.

## Real-time Customer Profile

With Profile, you can see a holistic view of each of your individual customers by combining data from a multitude of sources, including online, offline, CRM, and third party data. Profile allows you to consolidate this disparate customer data from different channels into a unified view that offers an actionable, timestamped account of every customer interaction.

This is done through the use of identities, and the ability to stitch these identities together as more becomes known about your customer.
