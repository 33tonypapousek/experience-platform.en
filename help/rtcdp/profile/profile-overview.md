# A unified view of your customer in Real-time CDP

Real-time Customer Data Platform (Real-time CDP) enables you to drive coordinated and consistent experiences for your customers no matter where or when they interact with your brand. Delivering these personalized experiences so that they feel relevant and timely is no small feat, but it can be achieved through the use of Real-time Customer Profile, part of Adobe Experience Platform.

Real-time CDP is built on top of Adobe Experience Platform and utilizes many of the Experience Platform services and functionality, including the creation of Real-time Customer Profiles, aggregated from customer data across your many marketing channels and systems storing data for your organization.

## Real-time Customer Profile

With Profile, you can see a holistic view of each of your individual customers by combining data from a multitude of sources, including online, offline, CRM, and third party data. Profile allows you to consolidate this disparate customer data from different channels into a unified view that offers an actionable, timestamped account of every customer interaction.

This is done through the use of identities, and the ability to stitch these identities together as more becomes known about your customer.

## Identity Service

Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service helps you to gain a better view of your customers and their behavior by bridging together identities across devices and systems. Typically, your customers interact with your brand across multiple channels, this could include browsing your website online, making a purchase in-store, joining your loyalty program, or calling a help desk for support, to name a few. Across these multiple systems, there is an identity created for that customer, and Identity Service makes it possible to bring those identities together to see the complete picture.

Now, instead of five separate customers interacting with your brand across five different channels, you can see that this is the same customer, and you can ensure they receive a consistent, personalized, relevant experience through each interaction. As more becomes known about your customer (for example, an anonymous browser of your website decides to sign up for an account and log-in) that information is stitched together and the picture of your customer becomes increasingly more clear.

These identities, and relationships between them, are defined and maintained by Identity Service and leveraged by Real-time Customer Profile to build a complete picture of each individual customer and their interactions.
