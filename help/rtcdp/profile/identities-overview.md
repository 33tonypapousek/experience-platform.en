# Identities in Real-time CDP

This document will introduce the concept of identities and identity namespaces. 

It will link to the [Identities documentation on Adobe I/O](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/profile-identity-segmentation/profile-identity-segmentation-services.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/technical_overview/identity_services_architectural_overview/identity_services_architectural_overview.md).

It will also link to a UI tutorial on defining identity namespaces.

## Identity Service

Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service helps you to gain a better view of your customers and their behavior by bridging together identities across devices and systems. Typically, your customers interact with your brand across multiple channels, this could include browsing your website online, making a purchase in-store, joining your loyalty program, or calling a help desk for support, to name a few. Across these multiple systems, there is an identity created for that customer, and Identity Service makes it possible to bring those identities together to see the complete picture.

Now, instead of five separate customers interacting with your brand across five different channels, you can see that this is the same customer, and you can ensure they receive a consistent, personalized, relevant experience through each interaction. As more becomes known about your customer (for example, an anonymous browser of your website decides to sign up for an account and log-in) that information is stitched together and the picture of your customer becomes increasingly more clear.

These identities, and relationships between them, are defined and maintained by Identity Service and leveraged by Real-time Customer Profile to build a complete picture of each individual customer and their interactions.
