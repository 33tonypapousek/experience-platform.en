# Real-time CDP administration overview

Real-time Customer Data Profile allows administrators to manage users, permissions, and sandboxes.

All admin features are powered by Adobe Experience Platform.

## Access control

Access control for Experience Platform is provided through the Adobe Admin Console. This functionality leverages product profiles in Admin Console, which link users with permissions and sandboxes.

## Sandboxes

Experience Platform provides sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.
