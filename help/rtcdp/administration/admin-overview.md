# Real-Time CDP administration overview

Real-Time Customer Data Profile allows administrators to manage role-based access control for users, as well as manage virtual sandboxes for application development. This document provides an overview for these capabilities.

All admin capabilities in Real-Time CDP are powered by Adobe Experience Platform. Therefore, this document also includes links to Experience Platform documentation where more detailed information is provided.

## Access control

**Access control** for Real-Time CDP is administered through the [Adobe Admin Console](http://adminconsole.adobe.com). This functionality leverages product profiles in Admin Console, allowing you to link users with permissions and sandboxes. Using this feature, administrators can grant or restrict access to specific Real-Time CDP capabilities for defined sets of users.

For more information on access control, see the [access control overview](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/permissions-and-sandboxes/permissions-and-sandboxes.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/technical_overview/access-control/access-control-overview.md) in the Experience Platform documentation.

## Sandboxes

Real-Time CDP is built to enrich digital experience applications on a global scale. Companies often run multiple digital experience applications in parallel and need to cater for the development, testing, and deployment of these applications while ensuring operational compliance.

In order to address this need, Adobe Experience Platform provides **sandboxes** which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

For more information on sandboxes, see the [sandboxes overview](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/permissions-and-sandboxes/permissions-and-sandboxes.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/technical_overview/sandboxes/sandboxes-overview.md) in the Experience Platform documentation.
