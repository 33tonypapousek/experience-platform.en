# Real-time Customer Data Platform home page and dashboards

The Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform (Real-time CDP) home page appears when you log in to Real-time CDP.

The first time you log in to Real-time CDP, no data is available yet on the dashboard and the homepage provides learning material for a first time user experience. As data is collected--in other words, as sources, profiles, segments, and destinations are created and data flows into the system--the dashboard automatically updates to display information about that data in metric cards. 

## Home page dashboard view

The dashboard shows information in several areas. Each category of information displays for the time range shown beneath the data.

The dashboard is divided into two areas.

* **The leaderboard** is across the top of the dashboard. The leaderboard shows numbers. When you first log in, only the leaderboard is visible.
* **Metric cards** display beneath the leaderboard. Metric cards show additional information, such as percentages or trends. Metric cards appear as data is collected.

Some information is shown in different ways on both the leaderboard and metric cards.

### Total profiles

The **[!UICONTROL Total profiles]** count shows the total number of people with profiles in your organization. It does not include profile fragments. This is your total addressable audience.
