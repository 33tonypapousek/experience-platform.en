# Privacy in Real-time CDP

Real-time Customer Data Platform (Real-time CDP) brings data from multiple enterprise systems together, allowing marketers to better identify, understand, and engage their customers. This data often includes private customer information that is applicable to privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

**Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service** allows you to streamline the process of keeping your data operations compliant with privacy regulations. Privacy Service automatically processes customer requests to access or delete their private data stored on Real-time CDP, as well as opt-out of the selling and storing of their information.

Real-time CDP is built on top of Adobe Experience Platform, and therefore the majority of Privacy Service capabilities are covered in the Experience Platform documentation. The following is a list of documentation to help you learn more about Privacy Service:

* [Privacy Service overview](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/gdpr/docs/alldocs.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/technical_overview/privacy_service_overview/privacy_service_overview.md): An introduction to Privacy Service and how it aligns with GDPR and CCPA.
* [Privacy Service UI tutorial](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/gdpr/docs/alldocs.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/tutorials/privacy_service_tutorial/privacy_service_ui_tutorial.md): A step-by-step guide for creating access and delete requests using the Privacy Service user interface, both for GDPR and CCPA.
* Opt-out requests in Experience Platform: See the "Handling opt-out requests" section in this overview document to learn how Real-time CDP handles general opt-out and sales/storage opt-out requests from customers.
