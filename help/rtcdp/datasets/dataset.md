# Datasets

The Datasets workspace within Experience Platform allows you to view and manage all of the datasets that your IMS organization has made, as well as create new ones.

View the Datasets workspace by clicking **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** in the left-hand navigation. The Datasets workspace contains a list of datasets, including columns showing Name, Created (date and time), Source, Schema, and Last Batch Status, as well as the date and time the dataset was Last Updated.

For information about using the Datasets workspace, see [Ingest data into Adobe Experience Platform](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/tutorials/alltutorials.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/tutorials/data_ingestion_tutorial/data_ingestion_tutorial.md).
