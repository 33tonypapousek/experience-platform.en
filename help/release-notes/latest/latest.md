# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

## Release date: April 8, 2020

## Data Governance

Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance is a series of strategies and technologies used to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data usage. It plays a key role within Experience Platform at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data access policies, and access control on data for marketing actions.

Getting started with data governance requires a thorough understanding of the regulations, contractual obligations, and corporate policies that apply to your customer data. From there, data can be classified by applying the appropriate data usage labels, and its use can be controlled through the definition of data usage policies.

The DULE framework simplifies and streamlines the process of categorizing data and creating data usage policies through the Experience Platform user interface and DULE Policy Service API. 

### New features

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Manage data usage policies in the UI  | Data usage policies can now be managed within the _Policies_ workspace in the Experience Platform UI. See the [policy user guide](../../data-governance/policies/user-guide.md) for more information.|

**Known issues**

* None.

For more information, please see the [Data Governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md).
