# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: February 24, 2021**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Experience Data Model (XDM) System](#xdm)

## Experience Data Model (XDM) System {#xdm}

Standardization and interoperability are key concepts behind [!DNL Experience Platform]. [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM), driven by Adobe, is an effort to standardize customer experience data and define schemas for customer experience management.

XDM is a publicly documented specification designed to improve the power of digital experiences. It provides common structures and definitions for any application to communicate with services on Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation delivering insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Upgraded search UI | Improved search capabilities are now available in the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab in the [!UICONTROL Schemas] workspace and the mixin selection dialog in the [!DNL Schema Editor].<br><br>When searching for a term previously, results would only include XDM resources whose name matches the search query. Now, in addition to resources whose name match the query, resources containing individual attributes that match the term will also be included. This allows you to search for XDM resources based on the attributes they contain rather than by resource name.<br><br>See the documents on [exploring XDM resources](../../xdm/ui/explore.md) and [managing schemas](../../xdm/ui/resources/schemas.md) in the UI for more information. |

For more general information on XDM, refer to the [XDM System overview](../../xdm/home.md).
