# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: July 28, 2021**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Data Science Workspace](#dsw)
- [Destinations](#destinations)
- [Experience Data Model (XDM)](#xdm)
- [Sources](#sources)


## Data Science Workspace {#dsw}

Data Science Workspace uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to create insights from your data. Integrated into Adobe Experience Platform, Data Science Workspace helps you make predictions using your content and data assets across Adobe solutions.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Library and OS updates | Data Science Workspace has made significant library and OS updates to improve functionality and usability. This includes JupyterLab 1.2.20, Python 3.7, Pandas 1.2.4, Tensorflow 2.4.1 with CUDA 11 and CUDNN 8 support, and more. To learn how to view the available libraries within JupyterLab, visit the [supported libraries](../../data-science-workspace/jupyterlab/overview.md#supported-libraries) section in the JupyterLab notebooks overview documentation. |

For more general information on Data Science Workspace, refer to the [Data Science Workspace overview](../../data-science-workspace/home.md).

## Destinations {#destinations}

Destinations are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Adobe Experience Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Faster incremental file exports](../../destinations/ui/activate-destinations.md#export-incremental-files) | You can now schedule incremental file exports for file-based destinations every 3, 6, 8, and 12 hours. Changing the file export schedule for segments that have already been saved is not currently supported. To re-export segments with a different schedule, you must create a new destination instance. This is a limitation which will be addressed in future releases. |
| [Support for deduplication keys](../../destinations/ui/activate-destinations.md#deduplication-keys) | Eliminate multiple records of the same profile in the export files by selecting a deduplication key. You can select a single namespace or up to two XDM schema attributes as a deduplication key. |

## Experience Data Model (XDM) {#xdm}

Experience Data Model (XDM) is an open-source specification that is designed to improve the power of digital experiences. It provides common structures and definitions for data in the form of schemas, which allow any application to communicate with Platform services.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Telecommunications industry filter | When adding field groups to a schema in the UI, you can now filter by the telecommunications industry. See the [telecommunications industry entity relationship diagram (ERD)](../../xdm/schema/industries/telecom.md) to see a recommended data model for telecom use cases. |

For more general information on XDM in Platform, refer to the [XDM System overview](../../xdm/home.md).

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Beta sources moving to GA | The following sources have been promoted from beta to GA: <ul><li>[[!DNL Amazon Redshift]](../../sources/connectors/databases/redshift.md)</li><li>[[!DNL Azure Table Storage]](../../sources/connectors/databases/ats.md)</li><li>[[!DNL PayPal]](../../sources/connectors/payments/paypal.md)</li></ul> |
| [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] (Beta) | You can now connect [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] to Experience Platform using the [!DNL Flow Service] API or the UI. See the [[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] connector overview](../../sources/connectors/marketing-automation/salesforce-marketing-cloud.md) for more information. |
