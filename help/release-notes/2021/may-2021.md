# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: May 26, 2021**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)]](#xdm)
- [[!DNL Sandboxes]](#sandboxes)

## [!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)] {#xdm}

Experience Data Model (XDM) is an open-source specification that is designed to improve the power of digital experiences. It provides common structures and definitions for any application to communicate with services on Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Schema field groups | The term "mixin" has been updated to "field group". This change is reflected across the Adobe Experience Platform UI. In addition, the Schema Registry API has a new [field groups endpoint](../../xdm/api/field-groups.md), while the mixins endpoint has been deprecated as a legacy endpoint. See the [XDM documentation](../../xdm/home.md) for more information. |

## [!DNL Sandboxes] {#sandboxes}

Adobe Experience Platform is built to enrich digital experience applications on a global scale. Companies often run multiple digital experience applications in parallel and need to cater for the development, testing, and deployment of these applications while ensuring operational compliance.

In order to address this need, Experience Platform provides sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Multiple production sandboxes | You can now create and manage multiple production sandboxes in your IMS Org and dedicate specific production sandboxes to distinct lines of business, brands, projects or regions. See the tutorials on creating a production sandbox [in the UI](../../sandboxes/ui/user-guide.md) or [using the API](../../sandboxes/api/create-sandbox.md) for more information. |

For more information on sandboxes, see the [sandboxes overview](../../sandboxes/home.md).
