Experience Data Model (XDM) is an open-source specification that is designed to improve the power of digital experiences. It provides common structures and definitions for any application to communicate with services on Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

| Schema field groups | The term "mixin" has been updated to "field group". This change is reflected across the Adobe Experience Platform UI. In addition, the Schema Registry API has a new [field groups endpoint](../../xdm/api/field-groups.md), while the mixins endpoint has been deprecated as a legacy endpoint. See the [XDM documentation](../../xdm/home.md) for more information. |
