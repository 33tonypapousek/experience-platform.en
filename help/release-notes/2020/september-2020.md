Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Privacy Service] provides a RESTful API and user interface to help you manage these data requests from your customers. With [!DNL Privacy Service], you can submit requests to access and delete private or personal customer data from Adobe Experience Cloud applications, facilitating automated compliance with legal and organizational privacy regulations.
