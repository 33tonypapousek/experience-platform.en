# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: May 13, 2020**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Adobe Experience Platform release notes](#adobe-experience-platform-release-notes)

  - [User interface updates {#ux}](#user-interface-updates-ux)
  - [Data Science Workspace {#dsw}](#data-science-workspace-dsw)
  - [Destinations {#destinations}](#destinations-destinations)
  - [Experience Platform Web SDK and Experience Platform Edge Network {#edge}](#experience-platform-web-sdk-and-experience-platform-edge-network-edge)
  - [Sources {#sources}](#sources-sources)

## User interface updates {#ux}

Adobe Experience Platform is releasing updates to the domain and header bar to improve your experience and unify with other Experience Cloud applications.

- Easier switching between your organizations or to a different application
- Improved user help, including featured articles and context-relevant documentation in the Help menu
- Ability to give feedback about the Experience Platform and file support tickets  

The roll-out of the new experience is gradual. You can view the experience at [https://experience.adobe.com/platform](https://experience.adobe.com/platform).

## Data Science Workspace {#dsw}

Data Science Workspace uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to unleash insights from your data. Integrated into Adobe Experience Platform, Data Science Workspace helps you make predictions using your content and data assets across Adobe solutions. One of the ways Data Science Workspace accomplishes this is through the use of JupyterLab. JupyterLab is a web-based user interface for <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Project Jupyter</a> and is tightly integrated into Adobe Experience Platform. It provides an interactive development environment for data scientists to work with Jupyter notebooks, code, and data.

**New features**

|Feature | Description|
|--- | ---|
| JupyterLab Launcher | The JupyterLab Launcher now includes starters for Spark 2.4 notebooks. Spark 2.3 notebook starters are now marked as deprecated and set to be removed in a subsequent release. |
| Spark 2.4 | New Scala (Spark) and PySpark recipes now use Spark 2.4. |
| Kernels | Scala (Spark) notebooks are now authored via the Scala kernel. PySpark notebooks are now authored via the Python Kernel. The Spark and PySpark kernel are deprecated and set to be removed in a subsequent release. |
| Recipes | New PySpark and Spark recipes now follow the Docker workflow similar to Python and R recipes.|

For more information on migrating your notebooks and recipes to use Spark 2.4, please see the [notebook migration guide](../../data-science-workspace/recipe-notebook-migration.md). For more general information on Data Science Workspace, see the [overview documentation](../../data-science-workspace/home.md).

## Destinations {#destinations}

In [Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform](../../rtcdp/overview.md), destinations are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that activate data to those partners in a seamless way.

**New destinations**

Adobe Real-time CDP now supports data activation to streaming cloud storage destinations, allowing you to export audience data and events to these destinations in JSON format. You can then describe business logic on top of these events in your destinations. See below for details:

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] and [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] destinations in Adobe Real-time CDP are currently in beta. The documentation and the functionality are subject to change.

|Documentation | Description|
|--- | ---|
|[(Beta) Amazon Kinesis destination](/help/rtcdp/destinations/amazon-kinesis-destination.md) | This article explains how to create a real-time outbound connection to your [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] storage to stream data from Adobe Experience Platform.  |
|[(Beta) Azure Event Hubs destination](/help/rtcdp/destinations/azure-event-hubs-destination.md) | This article explains how to create a real-time outbound connection to your [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] storage to stream data from Adobe Experience Platform.  |
| [API tutorial - Connect to streaming destinations and activate data](/help/rtcdp/destinations/streaming-destinations-api-tutorial.md) | This tutorial demonstrates how to use API calls to connect to your Adobe Experience Platform data, create a connection to a streaming cloud storage destination (Amazon Kinesis or Azure Event Hubs), create a dataflow to your new created destination, and activate data to your new created destination. |

For more information, please see the [Destinations overview](/help/rtcdp/destinations/destinations-overview.md).

## Experience Platform Web SDK and Experience Platform Edge Network {#edge}

The Experience Platform Web SDK and Experience Platform Edge Network allow users to send data to the Adobe Experience Platform and other Adobe Solutions in real-time for end-user devices and browsers. The most recent list of use cases can be found in our [public roadmap](https://github.com/adobe/alloy/projects/5) which is updated often.

**New features**

|Feature | Description|
|--- | ---|
|Support for ECID | The SDK supports ECID out of the box without any additional libraries or information to install |
| Configuration UI | Manage your configuration ID settings with the new edge configuration UI in Launch, must be whitelisted to access |
| Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK Mixin | A mixin for use with the Experience Platform web SDK that encompasses all the supported fields. |
| Course Consent Controls | Gives companies controls over opt-in and opt-out of the Experience Platform Web SDK|
| Client-side Debugging Support in the new Experience Cloud Debugger Extension | See requests from the Experience Platform web SDK as well as edge traces to see how data flows through the system. |
| Adobe Analytics | Send data to Analytics report suites via the edge configuration. XDM is flattened into context data, supports multi-suite tagging |
| Adobe Target | Support for Adobe Target. Including VEC, Form based composer, A/B, XT, Automated Personalization, MVT|
| Adobe Audience Manager Support | Support for Audience Manager ID syncs, URL destinations and Cookie Destinations |
| Identity Syncing | Renamed `setCustomersIds` to `syncIdentity` to make it more clear |
| XDM Object Builder | In the launch extension you can now build XDM objects as Data Elements |

For more information on Platform Web SDK and Edge Network, refer to the [documentation](../../edge/home.md).

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Additional API and UI support for cloud storage systems | New source connectors for Azure File Storage. |
| Additional API and UI support for databases | New source connectors for Azure Data Explorer, IBM DB2, and Oracle DB. |
| Adobe Audience Manager to Experience Platform data sharing | The provisioning process for the Audience Manager connector has been updated. Audience Manager datasets for Profile are now disabled by default. You can manually choose which datasets to promote to Real-time CDP. The new default settings are not retroactive and only impact provisioning for new Audience Manager connectors. See more information in the [Audience Manager](../../sources/tutorials/ui/create/adobe-applications/audience-manager.md) tutorial. |

**Known issues**
