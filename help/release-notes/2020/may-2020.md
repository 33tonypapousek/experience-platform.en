# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

## Release date: May 13, 2020

## Access control

Experience Platform leverages [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com) product profiles to link users with permissions and sandboxes. Permissions control access to a variety of Platform capabilities, including data modeling, profile management, and sandbox administration.

### Key features

|Feature | Description|
|--- | ---|
|Permissions | In the Admin Console, the _Permissions_ tab within a Platform product profile allows you customize which Platform capabilities are available for the users attached to that profile. Available permission categories include: Data Modeling, Data Management, Profile Management, Identities, Data Monitoring, Sandbox Administration, Destinations, Sources.|
|Access to sandboxes | The _Permissions_ tab within a Platform product profile can grant users access to specific sandboxes. See the section on [sandboxes](#sandboxes) below for more information.|

For more information, please see the [access control overview](../../access-control/home.md).

## Sandboxes

Experience Platform is built to enrich digital experience applications on a global scale. Companies often run multiple digital experience applications in parallel and need to cater for the development, testing, and deployment of these applications while ensuring operational compliance. In order to address this need, Experience Platform provides sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

### Key features

|Feature | Description|
|--- | ---|
|Production sandbox | Experience Platform provides a single production sandbox, which cannot be deleted or reset.|
|Non-production sandboxes | Multiple non-production sandboxes can be created for a single Platform instance, allowing you to test features, run experiments, and make custom configurations without impacting your production sandbox.|
|Sandbox switcher | In the Experience Platform user interface, the sandbox switcher in the top-left corner of the screen allows you to switch between available sandboxes through a dropdown menu.|
|`x-sandbox-name` header | All calls to Experience Platform APIs must now include the new `x-sandbox-name` header, whose value references the `name` attribute of the sandbox the operation will take place in.|

For more information, please see the [sandboxes overview](../../sandboxes/home.md).

## Data Science Workspace

Data Science Workspace uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to unleash insights from your data. Integrated into Adobe Experience Platform, Data Science Workspace helps you make predictions using your content and data assets across Adobe solutions. With Adobe Experience Platforms most recent update, Data Science Workspace has two variants. Data Science Workspace Foundation and Data Science Workspace Intelligence Pack. Foundation is included with Platform and Intelligence Pack is an optional upgrade. With these changes, the *Models* and *Services* tabs are only visible with Intelligence Pack provisioned for your org.

### Key features

|Feature | Description|
|--- | ---|
| Data Science Workspace Foundation | Included with Platform, Foundation provides access to notebooks. Easily access, explore, and prep your behavioral and transactional data. Examples include: <br>- Access to the JupyterLab Notebook interface with support for Python and R. <br>- Ability to explore and derive insights with minimal effort. <br>- Ability to easily write data sets back into Experience Platform. <br>- The power to use insights to analyze and predict business outcomes.|
| Data Science Workspace (Intelligence Pack) | Intelligence Pack is a Data Science Workspace upgrade that unlocks the *models* and *services* tabs. Intelligence Pack allows you to: <br>- Leverage larger datasets to train machine learning models.<br>- Develop complex models with technologies such as Spark and TensorFlow.<br>- Seamlessly Package models and deploy them in Intelligence Services<br>- Automate insights by configuring training and scoring schedules.
