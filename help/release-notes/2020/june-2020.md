# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: June 10, 2020**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Data Science Workspace](#dsw)

## Data Science Workspace {#dsw}

Data Science Workspace uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to unleash insights from your data. Integrated into Adobe Experience Platform, Data Science Workspace helps you make predictions using your content and data assets across Adobe solutions.

Data Science Workspace has been working on new ways to enable better experiences and predictions through the use of Real-time Machine Learning. Real-time Machine Learning provides the ability to author, test and deploy custom or imported pre-trained machine learning models in industry-standard interoperable model formats for real-time scoring/activation via an API endpoint.

Note that Real-time Machine Learning is in alpha and still currently being developed.

|Feature | Description|
|--- | ---|
| JupyterLab Launcher Real-time ML starter | The JupyterLab Launcher now includes a Python notebook starter for Real-time Machine Learning (Alpha). |

For more information on the Real-time Machine Learning alpha, please see the [Real-time Machine Learning overview](../../data-science-workspace/real-time-machine-learning/home.md).
