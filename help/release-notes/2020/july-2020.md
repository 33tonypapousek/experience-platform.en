# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: July 15, 2020**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Segmentation](#segmentation)

## Segmentation {#segmentation}

Adobe Experience Platform Segmentation Service provides a user interface and RESTful API that allows you to build segments and generate audiences from your Real-time Customer Profile data. These segments are centrally configured and maintained on Platform, making them readily accessible by any Adobe application.

Segmentation Service defines a particular subset of profiles by describing the criteria that distinguishes a marketable group of people within your customer base. Segments can be based on record data (such as demographic information) or time series events representing customer interactions with your brand.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Data usage policy enforcement | Any policy violations are surfaced to end users by clients of Enforcement Service when a violating action is attempted. |
| Streaming segmentation | Streaming segmentation can now qualify as a user into a segment as data lands into the platform, thereby dramatically reducing the segment qualification time. Streaming segmentation also alleviates the need to run segmentation jobs manually. |
