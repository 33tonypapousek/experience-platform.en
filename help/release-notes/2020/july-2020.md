# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: July 15, 2020**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Segmentation Service](#segmentation)

## Segmentation Service {#segmentation}

Adobe Experience Platform Segmentation Service provides a user interface and RESTful API that allows you to build segments and generate audiences from your [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile] data. These segments are centrally configured and maintained on [!DNL Platform], making them readily accessible by any Adobe application.

[!DNL Segmentation Service] defines a particular subset of profiles by describing the criteria that distinguishes a marketable group of people within your customer base. Segments can be based on record data (such as demographic information) or time series events representing customer interactions with your brand.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Data usage policy enforcement | In [!DNL Real-time Customer Data Platform], data usage policy violations are automatically surfaced when a violating action in the [!UICONTROL Segments] workspace is attempted. See the release notes for [Data Governance] for more information on automatic policy enforcement. |
| Streaming segmentation | Streaming segmentation can now qualify as a user into a segment as data lands into [!DNL Platform], thereby dramatically reducing the segment qualification time. Streaming segmentation also alleviates the need to run segmentation jobs manually. |

For more information on Segmentation Service, please see the [Segmentation overview](../../segmentation/home.md)
