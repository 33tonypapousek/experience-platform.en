# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: July 15, 2020**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Sources](#sources)

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| API and UI support for deleting dataflows | Dataflows that were made with errors or have become unnecessary can now be deleted through APIs or using the UI. |
| API and UI support for one-time ingestion | One-time ingestion for dataflows, where only the start date is provided and no future ingestion is scheduled, can now be executed through APIs or using the UI. |
