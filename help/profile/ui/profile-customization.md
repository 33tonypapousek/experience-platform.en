# [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile] detail customization {#profile-detail-customization}

Within the Adobe Experience Platform user interface, you can view and interact with [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile] data. The profile information displayed in the UI has been merged together from multiple profile fragments to form a single view of each individual customer. This includes customer details such as basic attributes, linked identities, and channel preferences. The default fields shown can also be changed at an organizational-level to display preferred Profile attributes. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for customizing the way in which Profile data is displayed within the Platform UI.
