# Data Access overview

Data Access supports Adobe Experience Platform by providing users tools focused on the discoverability and accessibility of ingested datasets within Experience Platform.

## Data Access API

Detailed information on using the Data Access API to connect with Platform can be found in the [Data Access developer guide](api.md).

## Python SDK

Users can read and write with datasets using the Python SDK. More detailed information about the Python SDK can be found in the [Python SDK tutorial](./tutorials/python-sdk.md). 

Data Science Workspace uses the Python SDK within Notebooks and Recipes. For more information about Data Science Workspace, please read the [Data Science Workspace overview](../data-science-workspace/home.md).

## Spark SDK

Users can read and write with datasets using the Spark SDK. More detailed information about the Spark SDK can be found in the [Spark SDK tutorial](./tutorials/spark-sdk.md).

Data Science Workspace uses the Spark SDK within Notebooks and Recipes. For more information about Data Science Workspace, please read the [Data Science Workspace overview](../data-science-workspace/home.md).

## Subscribe to data ingestion events

Platform makes specific high-value events available for subscription through the [Adobe Developer Console](https://www.adobe.com/go/devs_console_ui). For instance, you can subscribe to data ingestion events to be notified of potential delays and failures. See the tutorial on [subscribing to data ingestion notifications](../ingestion/quality/subscribe-events.md) for more information.
