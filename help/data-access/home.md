Data Access supports Adobe Experience Platform by providing users tools focused on the discoverability and accessibility of ingested datasets within Experience Platform.

## Data Access API

Detailed information on using the Data Access API to connect with Platform can be found in the [Data Access developer guide](api.md).

## Python SDK

## Spark SDK

## Subscribe to data ingestion events

Platform makes specific high-value events available for subscription through the [Adobe Developer Console](https://www.adobe.com/go/devs_console_ui). For instance, you can subscribe to data ingestion events to be notified of potential delays and failures. See the tutorial on [subscribing to data ingestion notifications](../ingestion/quality/subscribe-events.md) for more information.
