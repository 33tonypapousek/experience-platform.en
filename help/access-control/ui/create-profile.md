# Create a new product profile

To start creating a new profile, navigate to the *Product Profiles* tab and click **New Profile**.

![new-profile-button](../images/new-profile-button.png)

The _Create New Profile_ dialog appears, prompting you to enter a **Profile Name** and **Description** for the new profile. If you want the profile's display name to be different, uncheck **Same as Profile Name** and enter the display name in the text box that appears. Under *User Notifications*, you can toggle whether users will be notified by email when they are added or removed from the profile.

When finished, click **Next**.

The next screen prompts you to choose which Platform services to include in the profile. Click the toggle button next to a service to disable it. If a service is disabled, all functions associated with that service will not be available to users assigned to this product profile. When finished, click **Done**.

The new product profile is successfully created, and you are redirected to the profile's [edit permissions page](#edit-permissions). See the sections on [managing permissions](#manage-permissions-for-a-product-profile) and [managing users](#manage-users-for-a-product-profile) for more details on how to manage product profiles once they are created.
