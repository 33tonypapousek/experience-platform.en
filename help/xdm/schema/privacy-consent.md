# [!DNL Consents & Preferences] data type overview

The [!DNL Privacy/Marketing Preferences (Consent)] data type (hereinafter referred to as the "[!DNL Consents & Preferences] data type") is an [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) data type that is intended to support the collection of customer permissions and preferences generated by Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) and other sources from your data operations. 

This document covers the structure and intended use of the common fields provided by the [!DNL Consents & Preferences] data type.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

This document requires a working understanding of XDM and the use of the schemas in [!DNL Experience Platform]. Please review the following documentation before continuing:

* [XDM System overview](http://www.adobe.com/go/xdm-home-en)
* [Basics of schema composition](http://www.adobe.com/go/xdm-schema-best-practices-en)

## [!DNL Consents & Preferences] data type structure {#structure}

The [!DNL Consents & Preferences] data type provides several fields used to capture consent and preference information.

A **consent** is an option that allows a customer to specify how their data may be used. Most consents have a legal aspect, in that some jurisdictions require obtaining permission before data can be used in a particular way, or require that the customer has an option to stop that use (opt out) if affirmative consent is not required.

A **preference** is an option that allows the customer to specify how different aspects of their experience with a brand should be handled. These fall within two categories:

* **Personalization preferences**: Preferences regarding the analysis of past interactions with the brand to identify the customer's interests or create more personalized experiences.
* **Marketing preferences**: Preferences regarding whether a brand is allowed to contact a customer through various channels.

The following JSON shows an example of the type of data the [!DNL Consents & Preferences] data type is able to process. Information on the specific use of each of these fields is provided later in this section.

>[!NOTE]

>The example below is meant to illustrate the structure of the data that is sent to [!DNL Platform] via the [!DNL Consents & Preferences] data type, in order to give context to the rest of this section which explains the major fields provided by the data type. The full schema for the data type's structure can found in the [appendix](#full-schema) for reference purposes.

## xdm:choices {#choices}

`xdm:choices` contains three root-level fields that describe a customer's consents and preferences:

* [xdm:consents](#consents)
* [xdm:personalizationPreferences](#personalizationPreferences)
* [xdm:marketingPreferences](#marketingPreferences)

### xdm:consents {#consents}

The `xdm:consents` object captures the general consent settings selected by the customer. Each sub-field represents a specific data processing use case and the consents the customer has selected for that use case.

```json
"xdm:consents": {
  "xdm:dataCollection": {
    "xdm:choice": "yes",
    "xdm:timestamp": "2019-01-01T15:52:25+00:00",
    "xdm:basisOfProcessing": "consent"
  },
  "xdm:sellData": {
    "xdm:choice": "yes",
    "xdm:timestamp": "2019-01-01T15:52:25+00:00",
    "xdm:basisOfProcessing": "consent"
  },
  "xdm:shareData": {
    "xdm:choice": "yes",
    "xdm:timestamp": "2019-01-01T15:52:25+00:00",
    "xdm:basisOfProcessing": "consent"
  },
  "xdm:deviceLinking": {
    "xdm:basisOfProcessing": "vital_interest"
  },
  "xdm:pseudonymousAnalysis": {
    "xdm:choice": "no"
  }
}
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `xdm:dataCollection` | Represents the customer's permission for data collection. |
| `xdm:sellData` | Represents the customer's permission for having their data sold to second or third parties. If your business does not distinguish selling data from sharing data, the customer must also opt in for `xdm:shareData`. |
| `xdm:shareData` | Represents the customer's permission for having their data shared with second or third parties. If your business does not distinguish selling data from sharing data, then both this value and `xdm:sellData` should be the same value. Alternatively, you can also use `xdm:shareData` exclusively, as if its value is set to `no`, then data sharing will not occur regardless of the value of `xdm:sellData`. |
| `xdm:deviceLinking` | Represents the customer's permission for linking multiple devices belonging to the individual or household. |
| `xdm:pseudonymousAnalysis` | Represents the customer's permission for data analysis that may include an ID which may or may not be tied to an actual person. |
| `xdm:choice` | The customer-provided permission for the specified use case. See the [appendix](#choice-values) for accepted values and definitions. |
| `xdm:timestamp` | An ISO 8601 timestamp of when the consent setting changed, if applicable. If the timestamp value is the same as the one provided in the `xdm:choicesMetadata` section, then this field does not need to be included. |
| `xdm:basisOfProcessing` | Indicates the privacy-related basis by which the data should be collected and processed. By default, this field is set to `consent`, which indicates that the data should only be processed if the customer has provided consent (as reflected in `xdm:choice`).<br><br>In some circumstances, customers do not have be prompted to provide consent for personalization. `xdm:basisOfProcessing` must be included in the applicable consent option in these cases, indicating the reason why a consent prompt was not provided. When any value other than `consent` is provided for this field, the value of `xdm:choice` is ignored. See the [appendix](#basisOfProcessing-values) for accepted values and definitions.<br><br>Note that if this field is ever set to a value other than `consent`, the only way to switch it back is to explicitly provide this field as `consent`. In other words, you cannot simply specify a new `xdm:choice` and leave `xdm:basisOfProcessing` blank, as `xdm:basisOfProcessing` will retain its previous value. |

### xdm:personalizationPreferences {#personalizationPreferences}

`xdm:personalizationPreferences` captures customer preferences regarding which ways their data can be used for personalization. Customers can opt out of specific personalization use cases, or opt out of personalization entirely.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>`xdm:personalizationPreferences` does not cover marketing use cases. For example, if a customer opts out of personalization for emails, they will not stop receiving emails. Rather, the emails they receive will be generic and not based on their profile.
>
>By the same example, if a customer opts out of email marketing (through `xdm:marketingPreferences`, explained in the [next section](#marketingPreferences)), then that customer will not receive any emails, even if email personalization is permitted.

    "xdm:timestamp": "2019-01-01T15:52:25+00:00",
    "xdm:basisOfProcessing": "consent"
  }
}
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `xdm:anyPersonalization` | Represents the customer's preferences for personalization as a whole. The consent preference provided in this field is considered the "default" preference for any personalization use case, unless overridden by additional sub-fields provided under `xdm:personalizationPreferences`.<br><br>If the value is set to `no`, then all more specific personalization settings are ignored. If the value is set to `yes`, then all finer-grained personalization options will also be treated as `yes`, unless explicitly set to `no`. If the value is unset, then the values for each personalization option will be honored as specified. |
| `xdm:email` | Represents the customer's preferences for email personalization. If a customer opts out of email personalization, this does not prevent you from sending them emails.

| `xdm:basisOfProcessing` | Indicates the privacy-related basis by which the data should be collected and processed. By default, this field is set to `consent`, which indicates that the data should only be processed if the customer has provided consent (as reflected in `xdm:choice`).<br><br>In some circumstances, customers do not have be prompted to provide consent for personalization. `xdm:basisOfProcessing` must be included in the opt-out object in these cases, indicating the reason why a consent prompt was not provided. See the [appendix](#basisOfProcessing-values) for accepted values and definitions. |
| `xdm:source` | A string that indicates which feature, product, or method the customer used to provide their consent information. Common examples include customer management platforms (CMPs) and opt-out links sent via email. Note that for any individual consent or preference, if its source value is identical to that of the `xdm:source` field under `xdm:choicesMetadata`, then this field does not to be set for that consent or preference. | 


### xdm:marketingPreferences {#marketingPreferences}

`xdm:marketingPreferences` captures customer preferences regarding what marketing purposes their data can be used for. Customers can opt out of specific marketing use cases, or opt out of direct marketing entirely.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Aside from `xdm:preferredChannel`, all of the fields in `xdm:marketingPreferences` are the same as the first 11 [personalization preferences](#personalizationPreferences). These fields are duplicated because a customer may opt out of personalization for a certain channel (such as email), but still want to receive generic messages or interactions through that channel. If a customer selects `no` for a marketing preference, then its equivalent field in `xdm:personalizationPreferences` becomes irrelevant.

```json
"xdm:marketingPreferences": {
  "xdm:preferredChannel": "email",
  "xdm:anyMarketing": {
    "xdm:choice": "unknown"
  },
  "xdm:email": {
    "xdm:choice": "no",
    "xdm:reason": "Too Frequent"
  },
  "xdm:pushNotifications": {
    "xdm:choice": "yes",
    "xdm:source": "OurApp"
  },

  },
  "xdm:physicalMail": {
    "xdm:choice": "yes",
    "xdm:source": "OurApp"
  },
  "xdm:inVehicleMessages": {
    "xdm:choice": "yes",
    "xdm:source": "OurApp"
  },
  "xdm:inHomeMessages": {
    "xdm:choice": "yes",

  },
  "xdm:socialMedia": {
    "xdm:choice": "yes",
    "xdm:source": "OurApp"
  },
}
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `xdm:preferredChannel` | Indicates the customer's preferred channel for receiving communications. See the [appendix](#preferredChannel-values) for accepted values. |
| `xdm:anyMarketing` |  Represents the customer's preferences for direct marketing as a whole. The consent preference provided in this field is considered the "default" preference for any marketing channel, unless overridden by additional sub-fields provided under `xdm:marketingPreferences`.<br><br>If the value is set to `no`, then all more specific marketing settings are ignored, making it easy for a customer to opt out of all contact with your brand. If the value is set to `yes`, then all finer-grained marketing options will also be treated as `yes`, unless explicitly set to `no`. If the value is unset, then the values for each marketing option will be honored as specified. |
| `xdm:email` | Indicates whether the customer agrees to receive email. | 
| `xdm:pushNotifications` | Indicates whether the customer permits receiving push notifications. | 
| `xdm:inAppMessages` | Indicates whether the customer permits messages to be shown within the your app or website. | 
| `xdm:sms` | Indicates whether the customer agrees to receive text messages. | 
| `xdm:phoneCalls` | Indicates whether your brand may contact the customer via phone. | 
| `xdm:physicalMail` | Indicates whether the customer agrees to being contacted via traditional/physical mail. | 
| `xdm:inVehicleMessages` | Indicates whether it is okay to interact with the customer via technology installed in the customer's vehicle.   | 
| `xdm:inHomeMessages` | Indicates whether it is okay to interact with the customer via technology installed in the customer's home. | 
| `xdm:iotMessages` | Indicates whether it is okay to interact with the customer via IoT devices. | 
| `xdm:socialMedia` | Indicates whether it is okay to send messages to the customer on their social media accounts. | 
| `xdm:choice` | The customer-provided preference for the specified use case. See the [appendix](#choice-values) for accepted values and definitions. |
| `xdm:timestamp` | An ISO 8601 timestamp of when the preference changed, if applicable. Note that for any individual consent or preference, if the timestamp is the same as the one provided under `xdm:choicesMetadata`, then this field does not to be set for that consent or preference.  |
| `xdm:basisOfProcessing` | Indicates the privacy-related basis by which the data should be collected and processed. By default, this field is set to `consent`, which indicates that the data should only be processed if the customer has provided consent (as reflected in `xdm:choice`).<br><br>In some circumstances, customers do not have be prompted to provide consent for direct marketing. `xdm:basisOfProcessing` must be included in the opt-out object in these cases, indicating the reason why a consent prompt was not provided. See the [appendix](#basisOfProcessing-values) for accepted values and definitions. |
| `xdm:source` | A string that indicates which feature, product, or method the customer used to provide their consent information. Common examples include customer management platforms (CMPs) and opt-out links sent via email. Note that for any individual consent or preference, if its source value is identical to that of the `xdm:source` field under `xdm:choicesMetadata`, then this field does not to be set for that consent or preference. |
| `xdm:userIDFromSource` | If applicable, this represents the the ID for the customer provided by the source (indicated under `xdm:source`). For example, if a CMP collected this set of consents and preferences on a web page, and the CMP has their own ID value for this customer, that ID would be recorded here. This supports audits to compare the consents that are believed to be in place for a customer with those captured in Adobe Experience Cloud. |
| `xdm:reason` | When a customer opts out of a marketing use case, this string field represents the reason why the customer opted out. |

## xdm:choicesMetadata

`xdm:choicesMetadata` captures general metadata about the customer's consents and preferences whenever they were last updated.

```json
"xdm:choicesMetadata": {
  "xdm:version": "1.0.0",
  "xdm:timestamp": "2019-01-01T15:52:25+00:00",
  "xdm:userCountryRegionCode": "US",
  "xdm:countryRegionSource": "ip",
  "xdm:source": "CJM"
}
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `xdm:version` | The version of the [!DNL Consents & Preferences] schema being used. |
| `xdm:timestamp` | A timestamp for the last time any of the customer's consents and preferences were updated. This field can be used instead of applying timestamps to individual options in order to reduce load and complexity. |
| `xdm:userCountryRegionCode` | The ISO 3166 alpha2 country code, or ISO 3166-2 country plus state/province code, which represents the customer's country of origin, in order to better determine which legal privacy requirements are applicable. |
| `xdm:countryRegionSource` | The method used to determine the customer's country or region. See the [appendix](#countryRegionSource-values) for accepted values. |
| `xdm:source` | A string that indicates which feature, product, or method the customer used to provide their consent information. Common examples include customer management platforms (CMPs) and opt-out links sent via email. |

## Ingesting data using the data type {#ingest}

In order to use the [!DNL Consents & Preferences] data type to ingest consent data from your customers, you must create a dataset based on a schema that contains that data type.

See the tutorial on [creating a schema in the UI](http://www.adobe.com/go/xdm-schema-editor-tutorial-en) for steps on how to assign data types to fields. Once you have created a schema containing a field with the [!DNL Consents & Preferences] data type, refer to the the section on [creating a dataset](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#create) in the dataset user guide, following the steps to create a dataset with an existing schema.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you want to send consent data to [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile], it is required that you create a [!DNL Profile]-enabled schema based on the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] class that contains the [!DNL Profile Consent] data type. The dataset that you create based on that schema must also be enabled for [!DNL Profile]. Refer to the tutorials above for specific steps related to [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile] requirements.

## Appendix {#appendix}

The sections below provide additional reference information regarding the [!DNL Consents & Preferences] data type.

### Accepted values for xdm:choice {#choice-values}

The following table outlines the accepted values for `xdm:choice` and `xdm:optOutValue`:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pending` | The system has not yet received a final consent or preference value. This is most often used as part of a consent that requires two-step verification. For example, if a customer opts into receiving emails, that consent is set to `pending` until they select a link in an email to verify that they have provided the correct email address, at which point the consent would be updated to `yes`.<br><br>If this consent or preference does not use a two-set verification process, then the `pending` choice may instead be used to indicate that the customer has not yet responded to the consent prompt. For example, you can automatically set the the value to `pending` on the first page of a website, before the customer has responded to the consent prompt. In jurisdictions that do not require explicit consent, you many also use it to indicate that the customer has not explicitly opted out (in other words, consent is assumed). |
| `yes` | The customer has opted in to the consent or preference. In other words, they **do** consent to the use of their data as indicated by the consent or preference in question. |
| `no` | The customer has opted out of the consent or preference. In other words, they **do not** consent to the use of their data as indicated by the consent or preference in question. |
| `not_applicable` | The consent or preference in question does not apply to the customer. This value is most often used when the `xdm:basisOfProcessing` field has a value other than `consent`, because in that case the customer's `xdm:choice` value is irrelevant. However, it is also acceptable to leave `xdm:choice` unset in these situations. |
| `unknown` | The customer's consent or preference information is unknown. |

### Accepted values for xdm:basisOfProcessing {#basisOfProcessing-values}

The following table outlines the accepted values for `xdm:basisOfProcessing`:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `consent` **(Default)** | The customer's permission is required either explicitly or implicitly before data controlled by this consent or preference can be used for that purpose. This is the default value of `xdm:basisOfProcessing` if no other value is provided.<br><br>**IMPORTANT**: The value for `xdm:choice` is only honored when `xdm:basisOfProcessing` is unset or set to `consent`. If any of the other values outlined in this table are used for `xdm:basisOfProcessing` instead, the individual's consent choices are ignored.<br><br>It is generally expected that you will leave this value unset.
