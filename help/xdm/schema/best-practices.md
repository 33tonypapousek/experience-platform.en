# Best practices for data modeling in Adobe Experience Platform

[!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) is the core framework that standardizes customer experience data by providing common structures and definitions for use in downstream Adobe Experience Platform services. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation that allows you to gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and express customer attributes for personalization purposes.

Due to the fact that XDM is extremely versatile and customizable by design, it is therefore important to follow best practices for data modeling when designing your schemas. This document covers the key decisions and considerations you must make when mapping your customer experience data to XDM.

## Getting started

Before reading this guide, please review the [XDM System overview](../home.md) for a high-level introduction to XDM and its role within Experience Platform.

This guide focuses exclusively on key considerations regarding schema design. It is therefore strongly recommended that you refer to the [basics of schema composition](./composition.md) for detailed explanations of the individual schema elements mentioned throughout this guide.

## Basic guidelines

## Create a high-level ERD

## Map the ERD to XDM classes and fields

### Customer attributes

### Tracking data over time

### Segmentation use cases

### Activation use cases

### Aggregated values

### Cardinality

## Create schemas based on your XDM-compatible ERD
