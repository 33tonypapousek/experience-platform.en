# Ad-hoc schemas

In specific circumstances, it may be necessary to create an [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) schema with fields that are namespaced for usage only by a single dataset. This is referred to as an "ad-hoc" schema. Ad-hoc schemas are used in several data ingestion workflows, including ingesting CSV files and creating certain types of source connectors. For more information on ad-hoc schemas, including steps on how to create one, please refer to the [ad-hoc schema tutorial](../tutorials/ad-hoc.md).
