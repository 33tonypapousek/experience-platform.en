# Getting started in [!DNL Content and Commerce AI]

>[!NOTE]
>
>Content and Commerce AI is in beta. The documentation is subject to change.

[!DNL Content and Commerce AI] utilizes Adobe I/O APIs. In order to make calls to Adobe I/O APIs and the I/O Console Integration, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](../../tutorials/authentication.md). Note that for beta adding an API for [!DNL Content and Commerce AI] will be located under Experience Cloud once you are at the **Add API** step. See the screenshot below for an example. Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all the Adobe I/O API calls, as shown below:

- Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
- x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
- x-gw-ims-org-id: `{IMS_ORG}`

## Creating a Postman environment

Once you have set up your project and API within the Adobe Developer Console, you have the option to download an environment file for Postman.

## Reading sample API calls

This guide provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../landing/troubleshooting.md) in the Experience Platform troubleshooting guide.

## Next steps {#next-steps}

Once you have all your credentials ready, start by following the [[!DNL Content and Commerce AI] API guide](./api.md).
