# Sandboxes endpoint

Sandboxes in Adobe Experience Platform provide isolated development environments that allow you to test features, run experiments, and make custom configurations without impacting your production environment. The `/sandboxes` endpoint in the [!DNL Sandbox] API allows you to programmatically manage sandboxes in Platform.

This developer guide provides steps to help you use the [!DNL Sandbox] API to manage sandboxes in Experience Platform, and includes sample API calls for performing various operations.

## Getting started

The API endpoint used in this guide is part of the [[!DNL Sandbox] API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/sandbox-api.yaml). Before continuing, please review the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) for links to related documentation, a guide to reading the sample API calls in this document, and important information regarding required headers that are needed to successfully make calls to any Experience Platform API.

## Retrieve a list of sandboxes {#list}

You can list all sandboxes belonging to your IMS Organization (active or otherwise), by making a GET request to the `/sandboxes` endpoint.

**API format**

```http
GET /sandboxes?{QUERY_PARAMS}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{QUERY_PARAMS}` | Optional query parameters to filter results by. See the section on [query parameters](#query) for more information. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/sandbox-management/sandboxes?&limit=4&offset=1 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \

  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns a list of sandboxes belonging to your organization, including details such as `name`, `title`, `state`, and `type`.

The following table contains possible exceptions that could prevent a sandbox from being reset:

| Error code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `2074-400` | "Sandbox `{SANDBOX_NAME}` cannot be reset. The identity graph hosted in this sandbox is also being used by Adobe Analytics for the Cross Device Analytics (CDA) feature." |
| `2075-400` | "Sandbox `{SANDBOX_NAME}` cannot be reset. The identity graph hosted in this sandbox is also being used by Adobe Audience Manager for the People Based Destinations (PBD) feature." |

You can delete a sandbox by making a DELETE request that includes the sandbox's `name` in the request path.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Making this API call updates the sandbox's `status` property to "deleted" and deactivates it. GET requests can still retrieve sandbox's details after it has been deleted.

```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{SANDBOX_NAME}` | The `name` of the sandbox you want to delete. |
