# Prerequisite for using the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK

To use this library, you need to be on the allowlist. If you would like to get on the waiting list please reach out to your Certified software manager (CSM).

- Have a [1st-party domain (CNAME)](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/ec-cookies/cookies-first-party.html) enabled. If you already have a CNAME for Adobe Analytics, you should use that one. Testing in development works without a CNAME, but you need one before you go to production.
- Be entitled to Adobe Experience Platform. If you have not purchased Platform, Adobe will provision you with Experience Platform Data Services Foundation for use in a limited fashion with the SDK at no extra charge.
- Be using the latest version of the Visitor ID service.
