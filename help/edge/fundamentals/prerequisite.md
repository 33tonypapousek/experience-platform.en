# Prerequisites for using the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK

To use this SDK, you must first:

- Provision your organization for this feature. (If you would like to get on the waiting list, please reach out to your Certified software manager (CSM)).
- Have a [1st-party domain (CNAME)](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/ec-cookies/cookies-first-party.html) enabled. If you already have a CNAME for Adobe Analytics, you should use that one. Testing in development works without a CNAME, but you need one before you go to production.
- Be entitled to Adobe Experience Platform. If you have not purchased Adobe Experience Platform, Adobe will provision you with Experience Platform Data Services Foundation for use in a limited fashion with the SDK at no extra charge.
- Be using the latest version of the Visitor ID service.
