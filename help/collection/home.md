## Simpler implementations, faster client-side performance

Adobe Experience Platform Web and Mobile SDKs collapse and compress all Adobe product libraries into a single web or mobile SDK. Compressing the libraries speeds up and simplifies data collection into a single stream from these devices to Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network.

Adobe Experience Platform Server SDK streams data from any server to Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network.

## Flip-the-switch process to deploy Adobe technology

Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network is a globally distributed, fast, and reliable network of servers capable of receiving and processing data at tremendous scale. Using Adobe Experience Platform Data Streams you can turn on Adobe products server-side without changing client-side code.
