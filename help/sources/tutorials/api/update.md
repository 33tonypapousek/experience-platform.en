# Update connection information using the Flow Service API

In some circumstances, it may be required to update the details of an existing source connection. [!DNL Flow Service] provides you with the ability to add, edit, and delete details of an existing batch or streaming connection, including its name, description, and credentials. Additionally, [!DNL Flow Service] also allows you to update the information and schedule of an existing dataflow.

This tutorial covers the steps for updating the details and credentials of an existing connection, as well as the details and schedule of an existing dataflow using the [[!DNL Flow Service API]](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/flow-service.yaml).

## Getting started

This tutorial requires you to have a valid connection ID and a valid flow ID. If you do not have these values, select your connector of choice from the [sources overview](../../home.md) and follow the steps outlined before attempting this tutorial.

This tutorial also requires you to have a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully update your connection's information using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the Experience Platform troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to Platform APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all Experience Platform API calls, as shown below:

* `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
* `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`
* `x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}`

All resources in Experience Platform, including those belonging to [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

* `x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

* `Content-Type: application/json`

## Look up connection details

>[!NOTE]
>This tutorial uses the [Salesforce source connector](../../connectors/crm/salesforce.md) as an example, but the steps outlined apply to any of the [available source connectors](../../home.md).

The first step in updating your connection information is to retrieve connection details using your connection ID.

**API format**

```http
GET /connections/{CONNECTION_ID}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{CONNECTION_ID}` | The unique `id` value for the connection you want to retrieve. |

**Request**

The following retrieves information regarding your connection ID.

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/139f6a5f-a78b-4744-9f6a-5fa78bd74431' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the current details of your connection including its credentials, unique identifier (`id`), and version.

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "createdAt": 1597973312000,
            "updatedAt": 1597973312000,
            "createdBy": "{CREATED_BY}",
            "updatedBy": "{UPDATED_BY}",
            "createdClient": "{CREATED_CLIENT}",
            "updatedClient": "{UPDATED_CLIENT}",
            "sandboxName": "{SANDBOX_NAME}",
            "id": "139f6a5f-a78b-4744-9f6a-5fa78bd74431",
            "name": "E2E_SF Base_Connection",

                "id": "cfc0fee1-7dc0-40ef-b73e-d8b134c436f5",
                "version": "1.0"
            },
            "state": "enabled",
            "auth": {
                "specName": "Basic Authentication",
                "params": {
                    "securityToken": "{SECURITY_TOKEN}",
                    "password": "{PASSWORD}",
                    "username": "my-salesforce-account",
                    "environmentUrl": "login.salesforce.com"
                }
            },
            "version": "\"1400dd53-0000-0200-0000-5f3f23450000\"",
            "etag": "\"1400dd53-0000-0200-0000-5f3f23450000\""
        }
    ]
}
```

## Update connection

Once you have an existing connection ID, perform a PATCH request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>A PATCH request requires the use of the `If-Match` header. The value for this header is your connection's unique version.

**API format**

```http
PATCH /connections/{CONNECTION_ID}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{CONNECTION_ID}` | The unique `id` value for the connection you want to update. |

**Request**

The following request provides new information to update your connection with.

```shell

## Update a dataflow

>[!IMPORTANT]
>A PATCH request requires the use of the `If-Match` header. The value for this header is your dataflow's unique version.

To update the run schedule of a flow, perform a PATCH request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing your flow ID, version, and the new schedule you want to use.

**API format**

```http
PATCH /flows/{FLOW_ID}
```

**Request**

The following request updates your flow run schedule.

```shell
curl -X PATCH \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/flows/2edc08ac-4df5-4fe6-936f-81a19ce92f5c' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
    -H 'If-Match: "1a0037e4-0000-0200-0000-602e06f60000"' \
    -d '[
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/scheduleParams/frequency",
        "value": "week"
    }
]'
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `op` | The operation call used to define the action needed to update the connection. Operations include: `add`, `replace`, and `remove`. |
| `path` | The path of the parameter to be updated. |
| `value` | The new value you want to update your parameter with. |

**Response**

```json
{
    "id": "2edc08ac-4df5-4fe6-936f-81a19ce92f5c",
    "etag": "\"5400d99c-0000-0200-0000-60358d540000\""
}
```
