# Access flow run notifications

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Flow Service](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/flow-service.yaml) is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

With the [!DNL Experience Platform] user interface, you can subscribe to events and use webhooks to receive notifications regarding the status of your flow runs. These notifications contain information about the success of your flow run or errors that contributed to a run's failure. This tutorial provides steps on how to subscribe to events, register webhooks, and receive flow run notifications containing information on the status of your dataflow.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [Experience Data Model (XDM) System](../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which [!DNL Experience Platform] organizes customer experience data.
*   [Real-time Customer Profile](../../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
*   [Data Ingestion](../../../ingestion/home.md): Data Ingestion represents the multiple methods by which [!DNL Platform] ingests data from these sources, as well as how that data is persisted within the Data Lake for use by downstream [!DNL Platform] services.
