# Update account information in the UI

Source connectors in Adobe Experience Platform provide the ability to ingest externally sourced data on a scheduled basis. This tutorial provides steps for updating the information and credentials of an existing account from the **[!UICONTROL Sources]** workspace.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

- [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)] System](../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which [!DNL Experience Platform] organizes customer experience data.
  - [Basics of schema composition](../../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
  - [Schema Editor tutorial](../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md): Learn how to create custom schemas using the Schema Editor UI.
- [[!DNL Real-time Customer Profile]](../../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.

## Update accounts

Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform](https://platform.adobe.com) and then select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation bar to access the **[!UICONTROL Sources]** workspace. The **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** screen displays a variety of sources for which you can create connections with.
