# Monitor Dataflows for Streaming Sources in the UI

This tutorial covers the steps for monitoring dataflows for streaming sources using the PLatform UI.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Dataflows](../../../dataflows/home.md): Dataflows are a representation of data jobs that move data across Platform. Dataflows are configured across different services, helping move data from source connectors to target datasets, to [!DNL Identity] and [!DNL Profile], and to [!DNL Destinations].
  * [Dataflow runs](../../notifications.md): Dataflow runs are the recurring scheduled jobs based on the frequency configuration of selected dataflows.
* [Sources](../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.

## Monitor dataflows for streaming sources

In the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation bar to access the [!UICONTROL Sources] workspace. The [!UICONTROL Catalog] screen displays a variety of sources for which you can create an account with.

To view existing dataflows for streaming sources, select **[!UICONTROL Dataflows]**.
