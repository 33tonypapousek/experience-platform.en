# Create an Adobe Analytics Classifications Data connector in the UI

This tutorial provides steps for creating an Adobe Analytics Classifications Data connector in the UI to bring classifications data into Adobe Experience Platform.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [Experience Data Model (XDM) System](../../../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Experience Platform organizes customer experience data.
*   [Real-time Customer Profile](../../../../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
*   [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

## Create a source connection with Classifications Data connector

Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform](platform.adobe.com) and then select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation bar to access the sources workspace. The *Catalog* screen displays available sources to create inbound connections with. Each source card shows an option to either configure a new account, or add data to an existing account.

You can select the appropriate category from the catalog on the left-hand side of your screen. Alternatively, you can find the specific source you wish to work with using the search option.

Under the *Adobe applications* category, select the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics]** card and then select **[!UICONTROL Add data]** to start working with Analytics Classifications Data.
