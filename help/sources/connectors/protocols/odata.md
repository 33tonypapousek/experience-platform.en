# (Beta) [!DNL Generic OData] connector

>[!NOTE]
>The [!DNL Generic OData] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides support for ingesting data from a third-party protocols application. Support for protocols providers include [!DNL Generic OData].

The documentation below provides information on how to connect [!DNL Generic OData] to [!DNL Platform] using APIs or the user interface:
