# (Beta) IBM DB2 connector

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for database providers like Microsoft, MySQL, and Azure. You can bring your data from these systems into Platform.

Different types of third-party databases are supported, including relational, NoSQL, or data warehouses. Support for database providers includes IBM DB2.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect IBM DB2 to Platform using APIs or the user interface:
