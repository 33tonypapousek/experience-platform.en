# (Beta) IBM DB2 connector

>[!NOTE]
>The IBM DB2 connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for database providers like [!DNL Microsoft], MySQL, and [!DNL Azure]. You can bring your data from these systems into [!DNL Platform].

Different types of third-party databases are supported, including relational, NoSQL, or data warehouses. Support for database providers includes IBM DB2.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect IBM DB2 to [!DNL Platform] using APIs or the user interface:

## Connect IBM DB2 to [!DNL Platform] using APIs
