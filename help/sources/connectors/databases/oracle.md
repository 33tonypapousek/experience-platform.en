>[!NOTE]
>The Oracle connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Different types of third-party databases are supported, including relational, NoSQL, or data warehouses. Support for database providers includes Oracle.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect Oracle to Platform using APIs or the user interface:
