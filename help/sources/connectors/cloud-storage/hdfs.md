# (Beta) [!DNL Apache] HDFS connector

>[!NOTE]
>The Apache HDFS connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for cloud providers like AWS, [!DNL Google Cloud Platform], and [!DNL Azure], allowing you to bring your data from these systems. Ingested data can be formatted as JSON, parquet, or delimited. Support for cloud storage providers include [!DNL Apache] HDFS.

## IP address allow list

The following IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources.
