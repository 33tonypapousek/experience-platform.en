# (Beta) [!DNL Apache] HDFS connector

>[!NOTE]
>The Apache HDFS connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for cloud providers like AWS, [!DNL Google Cloud Platform], and [!DNL Azure], allowing you to bring your data from these systems. Ingested data can be formatted as JSON, parquet, or delimited. Support for cloud storage providers include [!DNL Apache] HDFS.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect [!DNL Apache] HDFS to [!DNL Platform] using APIs or the user interface:
