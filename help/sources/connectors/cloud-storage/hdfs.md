# (Beta) Apache HDFS connector

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure, allowing you to bring your data from these systems. Ingested data can be formatted as JSON, parquet, or delimited. Support for cloud storage providers include Apache HDFS.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect Apache HDFS to Platform using APIs or the user interface:

## Connect Apache HDFS to Platform using APIs

- [Create an HDFS connector using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/create/cloud-storage/hdfs.md)
- [Explore a cloud storage system using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/explore/cloud-storage.md)
- [Collect cloud storage data using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/collect/cloud-storage.md)

## Connect Apache HDFS to Platform using the UI

- [Create an Apache HDFS source connector in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/create/cloud-storage/hdfs.md)
- [Configure a dataflow for a cloud storage connector in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/dataflow/batch/cloud-storage.md)
