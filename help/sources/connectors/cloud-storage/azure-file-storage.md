# (Beta) Azure File Storage connector

>[!NOTE]
>The Azure File Storage connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for cloud providers like AWS, [!DNL Google Cloud Platform], and [!DNL Azure], allowing you to bring your data from these systems.

Cloud storage sources can bring your own data into [!DNL Platform] without the need to download, format, or upload. Ingested data can be formatted as XDM JSON, XDM parquet, or delimited. Every step of the process is integrated into the Sources workflow. [!DNL Platform] allows you to bring in data from [!DNL Azure File Storage] through batches.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect [!DNL Azure File Storage] to [!DNL Platform] using APIs or the user interface:
