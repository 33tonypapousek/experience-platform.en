# Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 connector

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for cloud providers like AWS, [!DNL Google Cloud Platform], and [!DNL Azure], allowing you to bring your data from these systems.

Cloud storage sources can bring your own data into [!DNL Platform] without the need to download, format, or upload. Ingested data can be formatted as XDM JSON, XDM parquet, or delimited. Every step of the process is integrated into the Sources workflow. [!DNL Platform] allows you to bring in data from [!DNL Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2] (ADLS-Gen2) through batches.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect [!DNL Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2] to [!DNL Platform] using APIs or the user interface:

## Connect ADLS-Gen2 to [!DNL Platform] using APIs

- [Create an ADLS-Gen2 connector using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/create/cloud-storage/adls-gen2.md)
- [Explore a cloud storage system using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/explore/cloud-storage.md)
- [Collect cloud storage data using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/collect/cloud-storage.md)

## Connect ADLS-Gen2 to [!DNL Platform] using the UI

- [Create an ADLS-Gen2 source connector in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/create/cloud-storage/adls-gen2.md)
