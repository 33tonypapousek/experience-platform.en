# (Beta) [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] connector

>[!NOTE]
>The [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for cloud providers like AWS, [!DNL Google Cloud Platform], and [!DNL Azure]. You can bring your data from these systems into [!DNL Platform].

Cloud storage sources can bring your own data into [!DNL Platform] without the need to download, format, or upload. Ingested data can be formatted as XDM JSON, XDM parquet, or delimited. Every step of the process is integrated into the Sources workflow. [!DNL Platform] allows you to bring in data from [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] in real-time.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] to [!DNL Platform] using APIs or the user interface:
