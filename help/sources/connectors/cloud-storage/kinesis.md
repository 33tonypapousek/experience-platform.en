# AWS Kinesis connector

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

Cloud storage sources can bring your own data into Platform without the need to download, format, or upload. Ingested data can be formatted as XDM JSON, XDM parquet, or delimited. Every step of the process is integrated into the Sources workflow using the user interface. Support for cloud storage providers includes AWS Kinesis.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect AWS Kinesis to Platform using APIs or the user interface:
