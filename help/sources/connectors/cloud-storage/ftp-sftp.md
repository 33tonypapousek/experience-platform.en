# (Beta) FTP and SFTP connector

>[!NOTE]
>The FTP and SFTP connectors are in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for cloud providers like AWS, [!DNL Google Cloud Platform], and [!DNL Azure], allowing you to bring your data from these systems.

Cloud storage sources can bring your own data into [!DNL Platform] without the need to download, format, or upload. Ingested data can be formatted as XDM JSON, XDM parquet, or delimited. Every step of the process is integrated into the Sources workflow. [!DNL Platform] allows you to bring in data from an FTP or an SFTP server through batches.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect an FTP or an STFP server to [!DNL Platform] using APIs or the user interface:

## Connect FTP and SFTP to [!DNL Platform] using APIs

- [Create an FTP or SFTP connector using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/create/cloud-storage/sftp.md)
- [Explore a cloud storage system using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/explore/cloud-storage.md)
- [Collect cloud storage data using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/collect/cloud-storage.md)

## Connect FTP or SFTP to [!DNL Platform] using the UI

- [Create an FTP or SFTP source connector in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/create/cloud-storage/ftp-sftp.md)
