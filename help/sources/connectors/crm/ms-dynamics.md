# Microsoft Dynamics connector

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

CRM systems provide data that can help build customer relationships, which in turn, create loyalty and drive customer retention. Experience Platform provides support for ingesting CRM data from Microsoft Dynamics 365.
