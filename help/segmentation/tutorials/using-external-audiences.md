# Importing and using external audiences

Adobe Experience Platform supports the ability to import external audience, which can subsequently used as components for a new segment definition. This document provides a tutorial for setting up Experience Platform to import and use external audiences.

## Getting started

- [Segmentation Service](../home.md): Allows you to build audience segments from Real-time Customer Profile data.
- [Real-time Customer Profile](../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
- [Experience Data Model (XDM)](../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Platform organizes customer experience data.
- [Datasets](../../catalog/datasets/overview.md): The storage and management construct for data persistence in Experience Platform.
- [Streaming ingestion](../../ingestion/streaming-ingestion/overview.md): How Experience Platform ingests and stores data from client- and server-side devices in real-time.
