# Segment Match overview

Segment Match is a segment sharing service in Adobe Experience Platform that allows for two or more Platform users to exchange segment data in a secure, governed, and privacy-friendly manner. Segment Match uses Platform privacy standards and global identities such as a hashed email, hashed phone number, and global device identifiers. Segment Match aims to provide workflows for broader ID transformation and first-party matching, allowing users to collaborate on Platform using their first-party data.
