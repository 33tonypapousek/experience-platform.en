>The dashboard functionality outlined in this document is currently in alpha and is not available to all users. The documentation and the functionality are subject to change.

The Adobe Experience Platform user interface (UI) provides a dashboard through which you can view important information about your segments, as captured during a daily snapshot. This guide outlines how to access and work with the segment dashboard in the UI and provides more information regarding the visualizations displayed in the dashboard.  

For an overview of all of the Adobe Experience Platform Segmentation Service features within the Platform user interface, please visit the [Segmentation Service UI guide](overview.md).

## Segment dashboard data {#segment-dashboard-data}

The dashboard displays only the attribute (record) data in the system, and is an exact representation of the information at the time that the snapshot was taken. In other words, this is not an approximation or sample of the data and any changes or updates made to the data since the snapshot was taken will not be reflected in the dashboard until the next snapshot occurs.
