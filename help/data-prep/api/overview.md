# Mapping Service API guide

Data Prep allows data engineers to map, transform, and validate data to and from Experience Data Model (XDM). Data Prep appears as a "Map" step in the Data Ingestion processes, including CSV Ingestion workflow. 

The Mapping Service API, also known as the Data Prep API, includes multiple endpoints outlined below. Please visit the individual endpoint guides for details and refer to the [getting started guide](getting-started.md) for important information on required headers, reading sample API calls, and more.

## Functions

Mapping-set functions allow you to transform your data between source and destination schemas. You can use the `/languages/el` endpoint to validate your expressions as well as get a list of all the available mapping-set functions.

For detailed information on how to use mapping-set functions, please read the [functions endpoint guide](./functions.md).

## Mapping set

Mapping sets can be used to define how data in a source schema maps to that of a destination schema.
