# Adobe Experience Platform overview

>[!NOTE]
>Adobe Experience Platform documentation has recently moved. Please take a moment to review the new navigation and to update any existing bookmarks.
 
Adobe Experience Platform is the most powerful, flexible, and open system on the market for building and managing complete solutions that drive customer experience. Experience Platform enables organizations to centralize and standardize customer data and content from any system and apply data science and machine learning to dramatically improve the design and delivery of rich, personalized experiences.

Built on open APIs, Experience Platform exposes the full functionality of the system to developers, supporting the easy integration of enterprise solutions using familiar tools. Experience Platform also supports partners to build and integrate their own products and technologies as needed. This power and flexibility makes Experience Platform unique in the market. It gives partners, customers, and a community of developers a foundation on which to build innovations that drive The Experience Business: exceeding customer expectations by delivering a continually improving, fully-personalized experience drawn from a 360-degree view of the customer and their individual preferences.
