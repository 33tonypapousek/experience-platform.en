The **[!UICONTROL Map CSV to XDM schema]** workflow lets you upload and convert a CSV file to an XDM schema format. More information about this workflow can be found in the [mapping a CSV file to an XDM schema tutorial](../ingestion/tutorials/map-a-csv-file.md).

The **[!UICONTROL Create dataset from schema]** workflow lets you create a new dataset from a registered XDM schema. More information about this workflow can be found in the [datasets user guide](../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#schema).	

The **[!UICONTROL Create dataset from CSV]** workflow lets you create a new dataset by uploading a CSV file. More information about this workflow can be found in the [datasets user guide](../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#csv). 

## Data Science Workspace

The **[!UICONTROL Import recipe]** workflow lets you import and configure recipes. More information about this workflow can be found in the [import a packaged recipe tutorial](../data-science-workspace/models-recipes/import-packaged-recipe-ui.md).

The **[!UICONTROL Create model]** workflow lets you create a Model. More information about this workflow can be found in the [train and evaluate a Model tutorial](../data-science-workspace/models-recipes/train-evaluate-model-ui.md).

The **[!UICONTROL Publish a model as a service]** workflow lets you publish a created Model as a service that can be scored. More information about this workflow can be found in the [publish Model as a service tutorial](../data-science-workspace/models-recipes/publish-model-service-ui.md).
