# Adobe Experience Platform documentation



## Types of documentation

Documentation is provided in multiple formats, including overviews, tutorials, and guides for both the user interface and API. Here is a brief description of the most common documentation types that are available for Experience Platform services:

* **API reference:** Consult the API reference documentation for details about available endpoints, including headers, parameters, sample requests, and responses. These reference materials do not provide the same level of detail as the documentation. It is recommended to consult the developer guide for detailed API usage examples.
* **Developer guide:** The developer guide provides in-depth usage information for all available API endpoints. It includes available query parameters, sample requests, and same responses, as well as outlining "gotchas" to avoid when making calls to Platform APIs.
* **Overview:** An overview provides a high-level outline of the service or feature and how it interacts with other Platform services. The overview is the best place to start when learning about new features and functionality within Platform.
* **Troubleshooting guide:** Use the troubleshooting guide to find answers to frequently asked questions and information regarding error messages that you are likely to encounter when using the API. The Experience Platform troubleshoot guide provides support for general questions and errors, while individual services provide troubleshooting guides specific to their area.
* **Tutorial:** A tutorial is a step-by-step guide through the UI, API, or a mix of both, that leads to a specific outcome. Unlike the developer guide, a tutorial may only focus on one or two endpoints and is not an exhaustive API resource. Tutorials are often part of a larger workflow and feature "next steps" that describe which tutorials you may want to try next.
* **User guide:** The user guide outlines actions available in the Platform UI. These documents contain screenshots and steps specific to the user interface. Similar to the developer guide, the user guide outlines all available actions and options including "gotchas" to avoid. This is the most detailed resource for working with the UI.
