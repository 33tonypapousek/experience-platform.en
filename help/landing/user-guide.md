# Adobe Experience Platform user guide

Adobe Experience Platform is the most powerful, flexible, and open system on the market for building and managing complete solutions that drive customer experience. [!DNL Experience Platform] enables organizations to centralize and standardize customer data and content from any system and apply data science and machine learning to dramatically improve the design and delivery of rich, personalized experiences.

This guide provides an introduction to using the Platform user interface, explaining what the various components are used for.

## Top navigation bar
