# Consent collection in Adobe Experience Platform

Adobe Experience Platform allows you to collect customer consent data and integrate it into your stored customer profiles. This consent data can then be factored into whether data collection occurs for a specific customer, or whether their profiles are included in exported audience segments.

This document provides an overview of how to configure your data operations and profile schemas to accept customer consent data generated by your CMP.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This document focuses on collecting consent data using the Adobe consent standard. If you are collecting consent data in compliance with the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) 2.0, see the guide on [TCF 2.0 support in Real-time Customer Data Platform](../../../rtcdp/privacy/iab/overview.md).

## Prerequisites

This guide requires a working understanding of the various Experience Platform services involved in collecting consent data:

* [Experience Data Model (XDM)](../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which [!DNL Experience Platform] organizes customer experience data.
* [Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service](../../../identity-service/home.md): Solves the fundamental challenge posed by the fragmentation of customer experience data by bridging identities across devices and systems.
* [Real-time Customer Profile](../../../profile/home.md): Leverages [!DNL Identity Service] to create detailed customer profiles from your datasets in real-time. [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile] pulls data from the Data Lake and persists customer profiles in its own separate data store.
* [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](../../../edge/home.md): A client-side JavaScript library that allows you to integrate various [!DNL Platform] services into your customer-facing website.
    * [SDK consent commands](../../../edge/consent/supporting-consent.md): A use-case overview of the consent-related SDK commands shown in this guide.
* [Adobe Experience Platform Segmentation Service](../../../segmentation/home.md): Allows you to divide [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile] data into groups of individuals that share similar traits and will respond similarly to marketing strategies.

<!-- (Out of scope?)
In addition to the [!DNL Platform] services listed above, you should also be familiar with [destinations](../../destinations/overview.md) and their use in [!DNL Real-time CDP]. -->

## Consent collection flow summary {#summary}

The following process describes how consent data is collected after the system has been properly configured:

1. A customer provides their consent preferences for data collection through a dialog on your website.
1. Your CMP detects the consent preference change, and maps those changes to a standard XDM schema.
1. Using the [!DNL Experience Platform Web SDK], the structured consent data is sent to Adobe Experience Platform.
1. The collected consent data is ingested into a [!DNL Profile]-enabled dataset whose schema contains Adobe-standard consent fields.

In addition to SDK commands triggered by CMP consent-change hooks, consent data can also flow into [!DNL Experience Platform] through any customer-generated XDM data that is uploaded directly to a [!DNL Profile]-enabled dataset.

<!-- (Out of scope?)
Any segments shared with [!DNL Platform] by Adobe Audience Manager (through the [!DNL Audience Manager] source connector or otherwise) may also contain consent data, provided that the appropriate fields have been applied to those segments through [!DNL Experience Cloud Identity Service]. For more information on collecting consent data in [!DNL Audience Manager], see the document on the [Adobe Audience Manager plug-in for IAB TCF](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/overview/data-privacy/consent-management/aam-iab-plugin.html). -->

## Determine how to generate customer consent data within your CMP {#consent-data}

Since each CMP system is unique, you must determine the best way to allow your customers to provide consent as they interact with your service. A common way to achieve this is through the use of a cookie consent dialog, similar to the following example:

![](../../images/governance-privacy-security/consent/overview/consent-dialog.png)

This dialog should allow the customer to opt in or out of specific marketing use cases for their data. These consents and preferences should conform to the Adobe consent standard, as represented by the [Consents & Preferences XDM data type](../../../xdm/data-types/consents.md). 

## Create a dataset with Adobe-standard consent fields {#dataset}

Customer consent data must be sent to a [!DNL Profile]-enabled dataset whose schema contains Adobe-standard consent fields. Refer to the tutorial on [creating a dataset for capturing customer consent](./dataset-prep.md) for how to create the required dataset before continuing with this guide.

## Update [!DNL Profile] merge policies to include consent data {#merge-policies}

Once you have created a [!DNL Profile]-enabled dataset for collecting consent data, you must ensure that your merge policies have been configured to always include consent fields in each customer profile. This involves setting dataset precedence so that your consent dataset is prioritized over other potentially conflicting datasets.

For more information on how to work with merge policies, refer to the [merge policies user guide](../../../profile/ui/merge-policies.md). When setting up your merge policies, you must ensure that your profiles include all the required consent attributes provided by the Consents & Preferences data type, as outlined in the guide on [dataset preparation](./dataset-prep.md).

## Integrate the [!DNL Experience Platform] Web SDK to collect customer consent data {#sdk}

Once you have configured your CMP to collect customer consent settings from your website, you must integrate the [!DNL Experience Platform] Web SDK to collect those settings and send them to [!DNL Platform]. The [!DNL Platform] SDK provides two commands that can be used to send consent data to Platform (explained in the subsections below), and should be used when a customer provides consent information for the first time, and anytime that consent changes thereafter.

**The SDK does not interface with any CMPs out of the box**. It is up to you to determine how to integrate the SDK into your website, listen for consent changes in the CMP, and call the appropriate command. 

### Create a new edge configuration

In order for the SDK to send data to [!DNL Experience Platform], you must first create a new edge configuration for [!DNL Platform] in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch]. Specific steps for how to create a new configuration are provided in the [SDK documentation](../../../edge/fundamentals/edge-configuration.md).

After providing a unique name for the configuration, select the toggle button next to **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform]**. Next, use the following values to complete the rest of the form:

| Edge configuration field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Sandbox] | The name of the [!DNL Platform] [sandbox](../../../sandboxes/home.md) that contains the required streaming connection and datasets to set up the edge configuration. |
| [!UICONTROL Streaming Inlet] | A valid streaming connection for [!DNL Experience Platform]. See the tutorial on [creating a streaming connection](../../../ingestion/tutorials/create-streaming-connection-ui.md) if you do not have an existing streaming inlet. |
| [!UICONTROL Event Dataset] | ??? |
| [!UICONTROL Profile Dataset] | Select the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] dataset created in the [previous step](#dataset). |

![](../../images/governance-privacy-security/consent/overview/edge-config.png)

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** at the bottom of the screen and continue following any additional prompts to complete the configuration.

### Making consent-change commands

Once you have created the edge configuration described in the previous section, you can start using SDK commands to send consent data to [!DNL Platform]. These commands should be used as part of a CMP hook that listens for consent-change events.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For an introduction to the common syntax for all [!DNL Platform] SDK commands, see the document on [executing commands](../../../edge/fundamentals/executing-commands.md).

When your CMP hook detects a consent-change event, you can use the `setConsent` command to update that customer's consent data.

The `setConsent` command expects two arguments: (1) a string that indicates the command type (in this case, `"setConsent"`), and (2) a payload that contains a `consent` array, which must contain at least one object that provides the required consent fields, as shown below:

```js
alloy("setConsent", {
  consent: [{
    standard: "Adobe",
    version: "2.0",
    value: {
      "xdm:consents": {
        "xdm:collect": {
          "xdm:val": "y"
        },
        "xdm:share": {
          "xdm:val": "y"
        }
        "xdm:personalize": {
          "xdm:any": {
            "xdm:val": "y"
          }
        },
        "xdm:metadata": {
          "xdm:time": "2020-10-12T15:52:25+00:00"
        }
      }
    }
  }]
});
```

| Payload property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `standard` | The consent standard being used. This value must be set to `Adobe` in order to process Adobe-standard consent fields. |
| `version` | The version number of the consent standard indicated under `standard`. This value must be set to `2.0` for Adobe-standard consent processing. |
| `value` | A JSON object that conforms to the [Consents & Preferences data type](../../../xdm/data-types/consents.md), representing the customer's updated consent information. |

The `setConsent` command should be used as part of a CMP hook that detects changes in consent settings. The following JavaScript provides an example of how the `setConsent` command can be used for an example CMP hook (`OnConsentChanged`):

```js
CMP.OnConsentChanged(function () {
  // Retrieve the consent data generated by the CMP, and pass it to Alloy. 
  fetchConsentData(function (data, success) {
    if (success) {
      var consentXDM = data.consentXDM;

      alloy("setConsent", {
        consent: [{
          standard: "Adobe",
          version: "2.0",
          value: consentXDM,
        }]
      });
    }
  });
});
```

<!-- (Event support to be added in Phase 2)
#### Using events

You can also collect consent data on every event triggered in [!DNL Platform] by using the `sendEvent` command.

The `sendEvent` command should be used as a callback in appropriate event listeners on your website. The command expects two arguments: (1) a string that indicates the command type (in this case, `"sendEvent"`), and (2) a payload containing an `xdm` object that provides the required consent fields as JSON:

```js
alloy("sendEvent", {
  standard: "Adobe",
  version: "2.0",
  value: {
    "xdm:consents": {
      "xdm:collect": {
        "xdm:val": "y"
      },
      "xdm:share": {
        "xdm:val": "y"
      }
      "xdm:personalize": {
        "xdm:any": {
          "xdm:val": "y"
        }
      },
      "xdm:metadata": {
        "xdm:time": "2020-10-12T15:52:25+00:00"
      }
    }
  }
});
```

| Payload property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `xdm.consentStrings` | An array that must contain at least one object that provides the required consent fields. |
| `consentStandard` | The consent standard being used. This value must be set to "IAB" for TCF 2.0 consent processing. |
| `consentStandardVersion` | The version number of the consent standard indicated under `standard`. This value must be set to "2.0" for TCF 2.0 consent processing. |
| `consentStringValue` | The base-64-encoded consent string generated by the CMP. |
| `gdprApplies` | A Boolean value that indicates whether the GDPR applies to the currently logged-in customer. In order for TCF 2.0 to be enforced for this customer, the value must be set to "true". | -->

### Handling SDK responses

All [!DNL Platform SDK] commands return promises that indicate whether the call succeeded or failed. You can then use these responses for additional logic such as displaying confirmation messages to the customer. See the section on [handling success or failure](../../../edge/fundamentals/executing-commands.md#handling-success-or-failure) in the guide on executing SDK commands for specific examples.

<!-- (Likely out of scope)
## Export segments {#export}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Before you start exporting segments, you must ensure that your segments include all required consent fields. See the section on [configuring merge policies](#merge-policies) for more information.

Once you have collected customer consent data and have created audience segments containing the required consent attributes, you can then enforce TCF 2.0 compliance when exporting those segments to downstream destinations.

Provided that the consent setting `gdprApplies` is set to `true` for a set of customer profiles, any data from those profiles that is exported to downstream destinations is filtered based on the consent preferences for each profile. Any profile that does not meet the required consent preferences is skipped during the export process.

Customers must consent to the following purposes (as outlined by [TCF 2.0 policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/#Appendix_A_Purposes_and_Features_Definitions)) in order for their profiles to be included in segments that are exported to destinations:

* **Purpose 1**: Store and/or access information on a device
* **Purpose 10**: Develop and improve products

TCF 2.0 also requires that the source of data must check the destination's vendor permission before sending data to that destination. As such, [!DNL Real-time CDP] checks if the destination's vendor permission is opted in to for all IDs in the cluster before including data bound to that destination.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Any segments that are shared with Adobe Audience Manager will contain the same TCF 2.0 consent values as their [!DNL Platform] counterparts. Since [!DNL Audience Manager] shares the same vendor ID as [!DNL Real-time CDP] (565), the same purposes and vendor permission are required. See the document on the [Adobe Audience Manager plug-in for IAB TCF](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/overview/data-privacy/consent-management/aam-iab-plugin.html) for more information. -->
