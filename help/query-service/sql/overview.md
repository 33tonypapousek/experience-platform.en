# SQL reference

Query Service provides the ability to use standard ANSI SQL for `SELECT` statements and other limited commands. Query Service does not include Data Definition Language or Data Manipulation Language functionality. The data queried via the service comes from Experience Data Lake, which contains largely immutable datasets.
