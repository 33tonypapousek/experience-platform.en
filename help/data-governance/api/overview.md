# [!DNL Policy Service] API developer guide

Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Data Governance] allows you to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data use. It plays a key role within [!DNL Experience Platform] at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data usage policies, and controlling usage of data for marketing actions.

The [!DNL Policy Service] API provides several endpoints that allow you to programmatically manage data usage labels and policies, as well as evaluate marketing actions for policy violations. These endpoints are outlined below. Please visit the individual endpoint guides for details and refer to the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) for important information on required headers, reading sample API calls, and more.

To view all available endpoints and CRUD operations, visit the [Policy Service API swagger](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/dule-policy-service.yaml).
