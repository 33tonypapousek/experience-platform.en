# Policies

Data usage policies are rules your organization adopts that describe the kinds of marketing actions that you are allowed to, or restricted from, performing on data within [!DNL Experience Platform].

The `/policies` endpoint is used for all API calls related to viewing, creating, updating, or deleting data usage policies.

## List all policies

To view a list of policies, a GET request can be made to `/policies/core` or `/policies/custom` that returns all policies for the specified container. 

**API format**

```http
GET /policies/core
GET /policies/custom
```

**Request**

```SHELL
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/policies/custom \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

The response includes a "count" showing the total number of policies within the specified container, as well as the details of each policy including its `id`. The `id` field is used to perform lookup requests to view specific policies, as well as to perform update and delete operations.

## Look up a policy

Each policy contains an `id` field that can be used to request the details of a specific policy. If the `id` of a policy is unknown, it can be found using the listing (GET) request to list all policies within a specific container (`core` or `custom`) as shown in the previous step.

**API format**

```http
GET /policies/core/{id}
GET /policies/custom/{id}
```

**Request**

```SHELL
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/policies/custom/5c6dacdf685a4913dc48937c \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

The response contains the details of the policy, including key fields such as `id` (this field should match the `id` sent in the request), `name`, `status`, and `description`, as well as a reference link to the marketing action upon which the policy is based (`marketingActionRefs`).

```JSON
{
    "name": "Export Data to Third Party",
    "status": "DRAFT",
    "marketingActionRefs": [
        "https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/marketingActions/custom/exportToThirdParty"
    ],
    "description": "Conditions under which data cannot be exported to a third party",
    "deny": {
        "operator": "AND",
        "operands": [
            {
                "label": "C1"
            },
            {
                "operator": "OR",
                "operands": [
                    {
                        "label": "C3"
                    },
                    {
                        "label": "C7"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]

            "href": "https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/policies/custom/5c6dacdf685a4913dc48937c"
        }
    },
    "id": "5c6dacdf685a4913dc48937c"
}
```

## Create a policy {#create-policy}

Creating a policy requires the inclusion of a marketing action with an expression of the DULE labels that prohibit that marketing action. Policy definitions must include a `deny` property, which is a boolean expression regarding the presence of DULE labels. 

This expression is called a `PolicyExpression` and is an object containing _either_ a label _or_ an operator and operands, but not both. In turn, each operand is also a `PolicyExpression` object. For example, a policy regarding the export of data to a third party might be prohibited if `C1 OR (C3 AND C7)` labels are present. This expression would be specified as:

```JSON
"deny": {
  "operator": "OR",
  "operands": [
    {"label": "C1"},
    {
      "operator": "AND",
      "operands": [
        {"label": "C3"},
        {"label": "C7"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**API format**

```http
POST /policies/custom
```

**Request**

```SHELL
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/policies/custom \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -d '{
        "name": "Export Data to Third Party",
        "status": "DRAFT",
        "marketingActionRefs": [
          "../marketingActions/custom/exportToThirdParty"
        ],
        "description": "Conditions under which data cannot be exported to a third party",
        "deny": {
          "operator": "OR",
          "operands": [
            {"label": "C1"},
            {
              "operator": "AND",
              "operands": [
                {"label": "C3"},
                {"label": "C7"}
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }'
```

**Response**

If successfully created, you will receive an HTTP Status 201 (Created) and the response body will contain the details of the newly created policy, including its `id`. This value is read-only and is assigned automatically when the policy is created.

```JSON
{
    "name": "Export Data to Third Party",

                    }

        }
    },
    "id": "5c6dacdf685a4913dc48937c"
}
```

## Update a policy

You may find that you need to update a data usage policy after it has been created. This is done through a PUT request to the policy `id` with a payload that includes the updated form of the policy, in its entirety. In other words, the PUT request is essentially _rewriting_ the policy, therefore the body must include all required information as shown in the example below.

**API format**

```http
PUT /policies/custom/{id}
```

**Request**

In this example, the conditions for exporting data to a third party have changed, and now you require the policy that you created to deny this marketing action if `C1 AND (C3 OR C7)` data labels are present. You would use the following call to update the existing policy.

```SHELL
curl -X PUT \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/policies/custom/5c6dacdf685a4913dc48937c \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -d '{
        "name": "Export Data to Third Party",
        "status": "DRAFT",
        "marketingActionRefs": [
          "../marketingActions/custom/exportToThirdParty"
        ],
        "description": "Conditions under which data cannot be exported to a third party",
        "deny": {
          "operator": "AND",
          "operands": [
            {"label": "C1"},
            {
              "operator": "OR",
              "operands": [
                {"label": "C3"},
                {"label": "C7"}
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }'
```

**Response**

A successful update request returns an HTTP Status 200 (OK) and the response body will show the updated policy. The `id` should match the `id` sent in the request.

```JSON
{
    "name": "Export Data to Third Party",
    "status": "DRAFT",
    "marketingActionRefs": [
        "https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/marketingActions/core/exportToThirdParty"
    ],
    "description": "Conditions under which data cannot be exported to a third party",
    "deny": {
        "operator": "AND",
        "operands": [
            {
                "label": "C1"
            },
            {
                "operator": "OR",
                "operands": [
                    {
                        "label": "C3"
                    },
                    {
                        "label": "C7"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    "imsOrg": "{IMS_ORG}",
    "created": 1550691551888,
    "createdClient": "string",
    "createdUser": "string",
    "updated": 1550701472910,
    "updatedClient": "string",
    "updatedUser": "string",
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/policies/custom/5c6dacdf685a4913dc48937c"
        }
    },
    "id": "5c6dacdf685a4913dc48937c"
}
```

## Update a portion of a policy

A specific portion of a policy may be updated using a PATCH request. Unlike PUT requests that _rewrite_ the policy, PATCH requests update only the path specified in the request body. This is especially useful when you want to enable or disable a policy, as you need only send the specific path that you wish to update (`/status`) and its value (`ENABLE` or `DISABLE`). 

The [!DNL Policy Service] API currently supports "add", "replace", and "remove" PATCH operations, and allows you to combine several updates together into a single call by adding each as an object within the array, as shown in the following examples.

**API format**

```http
PATCH /policies/custom/{id}
```

**Request**

In this example, we are using the "replace" operation to change the policy status from "DRAFT" to "ENABLED" and to update the description field with a new description. We could have also updated the description field by using the "delete" operation to remove the policy description and then using the "add" operation to add a new once, like so:

```SHELL
[
    {
        "op": "remove",
        "path": "/description"
    },
    {
        "op": "add",
        "path": "/description",
        "value": "New policy description."
    }
]
```

When sending multiple PATCH operations in a single request, remember that they will be processed in the order in which they appear in the array, so ensure that you are sending the requests in the correct order where necessary.

```SHELL
curl -X PATCH \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/policies/custom/5c6dacdf685a4913dc48937c \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -d ' [
          {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "/status",
            "value": "ENABLED"
          },
          {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "/description",
            "value": "New policy description."
          }
        ]'
```

**Response**

A successful update request will return an HTTP Status 200 (OK) and the response body will show the updated policy ("status" is now "ENABLED" and "description" has been changed). The policy `id` should match the `id` sent in the request.


```JSON
{
    "name": "Export Data to Third Party",
    "status": "ENABLED",
    "marketingActionRefs": [
        "https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/marketingActions/custom/exportToThirdParty"
    ],
    "description": "New policy description.",
    "deny": {
        "operator": "AND",
        "operands": [
            {
                "label": "C1"
            },
            {
                "operator": "OR",
                "operands": [
                    {
                        "label": "C3"
                    },
                    {
                        "label": "C7"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    "imsOrg": "{IMS_ORG}",
    "created": 1550703519823,
    "createdClient": "string",
    "createdUser": "string",
    "updated": 1550712163182,
    "updatedClient": "string",
    "updatedUser": "string",
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/policies/custom/5c6dacdf685a4913dc48937c"
        }
    },
    "id": "5c6dacdf685a4913dc48937c"
}
```

## Delete a policy

If you need to remove a policy that you have created, you can do so by issuing a DELETE request to the `id` of the policy you wish to delete. It is best practice to perform a lookup (GET) request first to view the policy and confirm it is the correct policy you wish to remove. **Once deleted, policies cannot be recovered.**

**API format**

```http
DELETE /policies/custom/{id}
```

**Request**

```SHELL
curl -X DELETE \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/policies/custom/5c6ddb56eb60ca13dbf8b9a8 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

If the policy has been successfully deleted, the response body will be blank with an HTTP Status 200 (OK). 

You can confirm the deletion by attempting to lookup (GET) the policy again. You should receive an HTTP Status 404 (Not Found) along with a "Not Found" error message because the policy has been removed.
