# Policy enforcement overview

Once data usage labels have been applied to Platform datasets, and data usage policies have been defined for marketing actions against those labels, Data Governance capabilities allow you to enforce those policies and prevent data operations that constitute policy violations.

The Policy Service API provides endpoints that allow you to test marketing actions against datasets or arbitrary combinations of data usage labels in order to check if any policy violations occur. Based on the API response, you can then set up protocols within your experience application to appropriately enforce data usage policy compliance.

See the tutorial on [policy enforcement](../../tutorials/dule/policy-enforcement.md) for steps on how to evaluate policies using the API.
