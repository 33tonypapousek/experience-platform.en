# Identity graph viewer

Introduction on what the identity graph viewer is and what it can do for you.

## Getting started

Working with the identity graph viewer requires an understanding of the various Adobe Experience Platform services involved. Before beginning to work with the identity graph viewer, please review the documentation for the following services:

- [[!DNL Real-time Customer Profile]](../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, customer profile in real-time based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
- [[!DNL Identity Service]](./home.md): Gain a better view of individual customers and their behavior by bridging identities across devices and systems.
- [[!DNL Privacy Service]](../privacy-service/home.md): Identity namespaces are used to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), where GDPR requests can be made relative to a namespace.
