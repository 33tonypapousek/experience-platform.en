# Identity graph viewer

Introduction on what the identity graph viewer is and what it can do for you.

## Getting started

Working with the identity graph viewer requires an understanding of the various Adobe Experience Platform services involved. Before beginning to work with the identity graph viewer, please review the documentation for the following services:

- [[!DNL Real-time Customer Profile]](../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, customer profile in real-time based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
- [[!DNL Identity Service]](./home.md): Gain a better view of individual customers and their behavior by bridging identities across devices and systems.
- [[!DNL Privacy Service]](../privacy-service/home.md): Identity namespaces are used to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), where GDPR requests can be made relative to a namespace.

## Access the identity graph viewer

To use the identity graph viewer in the UI, select **[!UICONTROL Identities]** in the left-rail and then select on the **[!UICONTROL Identity graph]** tab. From the **[!UICONTROL Identity Namespace]** screen, click the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** icon to search for the namespace you intend to use.

The **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** panel appears. This screen contains a list of namespaces at your disposal, including information about a namespace's **[!UICONTROL Display name]**, **[!UICONTROL Identity symbol]**, **[!UICONTROL Owner]**, **[!UICONTROL Last updated]** date, and **[!UICONTROL Description]**.

Click the namespace you intend to use and click **[!UICONTROL Select]** to proceed.

Once you have selected a namespace, enter its corresponding value in the **[!UICONTROL Identity value]** text box and select **[!UICONTROL View]**.

The identity graph viewer appears. On the left side of the screen is the identity graph that contains all the nodes and how they are connected. The center of the screen displays a tabled list of **[!UICONTROL Identity types]** and their corresponding values.
