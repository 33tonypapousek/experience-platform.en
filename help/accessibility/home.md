# Accessibility in Experience Platform Overview

Accessibility refers to a series of features that make a software product usable, with as little effort as possible from users with visual, auditory, cognitive, motor, or other kindd of disabilities.

Adobe is an industry leader in accessibility and supports the creation of outstanding web experiences by encouraging developers to produce rich, engaging content that is accessible to all users. For more details about Adobe's commitment to accessibility, see Adobe Accessibility.

The most common accessibility features found in software products are: keyboard navigation, semantic structure, sufficient contrast between foreground elements and background elements, assistive technology support, and clear element labels.

Experience Platform is committed to providing accessible and inclusive features to all individuals, including users working with assistive devices, such as speech recognition software and screen readers. 

To help meet our goal of accessibility conformance, Experience Platform follows the internationally recognized best practices in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA to the extent possible.
